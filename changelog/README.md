# New changelog process

We are in the process of migrating to a new way of managing our changelog. Please see [dev-docs/changelog.md](../dev-docs/changelog.md) for details.

In a transition period it is still possible to merge your changelog entry to `solr/CHANGES.txt`, but on Wednesday October 29th this will not longer be the case.
