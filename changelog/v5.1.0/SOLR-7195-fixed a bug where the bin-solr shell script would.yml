title: Fixed a bug where the bin/solr shell script would incorrectly detect another
  Solr process listening on the same port number. If the requested listen port was
  8983, it would match on another Solr using port 18983 for any purpose. Also escapes
  the dot character in all grep commands looking for start.jar.
