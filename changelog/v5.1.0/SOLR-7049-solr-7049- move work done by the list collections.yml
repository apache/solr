title: '* SOLR-7049: Move work done by the LIST Collections API call to the Collections
  Handler (Varun Thacker via Anshum Gupta). * SOLR-7116: Distributed facet refinement
  requests would needlessly compute other types of faceting that have already been
  computed. (David Smiley, Hossman) * SOLR-7239: improved performance of min & max
  in StatsComponent, as well as situations where local params disable all stats (hossman)
  * SOLR-7050: realtime get should internally load only fields specified in fl.'
