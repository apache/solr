title: RunExecutableListener was deprecated and is disabled by default for security
  reasons. Legacy applications still using it must explicitely pass '-Dsolr.enableRunExecutableListener=true'
  to the Solr command line. Be aware that you should really disable API-based config
  editing at the same time, using '-Ddisable.configEdit=true'!
