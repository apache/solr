title: When the "minExactCount" parameters is provided in queries and it's value is
  lower than the number of hits, Solr can speedup the query resolution by using the
  Block-Max WAND algorithm (see LUCENE-8135). When doing this, the value of matching
  documents in the response (numFound) will be an approximation.
