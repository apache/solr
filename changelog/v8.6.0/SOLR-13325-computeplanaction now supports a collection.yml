title: 'ComputePlanAction now supports a collection selector of the form `collections:
  {policy: my_policy}` which can be used to select multiple collections that match
  collection property/value pairs. This is useful to maintain a whitelist of collections
  for which actions are taken without needing to hard code the collection names themselves.
  The collection hints are pushed down to the policy engine so operations for non-matching
  collections are not computed at all.'
