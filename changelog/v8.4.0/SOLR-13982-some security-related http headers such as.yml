title: Some security-related http headers such as Content-Security-Policy are now
  set. If you have custom html served up by Solr's http server that contains inline
  javascript, it will no longer execute in modern browsers. You can fix your JS code
  to not run inline anymore, or edit etc/jetty.xml and weaken the CSP, or remove/alter
  the headers with a reverse proxy.
