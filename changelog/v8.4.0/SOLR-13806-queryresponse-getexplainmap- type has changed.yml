title: QueryResponse.getExplainMap() type has changed from Map&lt;String, String&gt;
  to Map&lt;String, Object&gt; in order to accommodate structured explanations. This
  is a partially back-compatible change - compiled third-party components will work
  the same as before due to type erasure but source code changes may be required.
