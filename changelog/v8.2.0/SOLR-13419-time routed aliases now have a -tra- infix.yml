title: Time Routed Aliases now have a '__TRA__' infix preceding the timestamp portion
  of the collection names. collections with the old format will not be altered and
  will continue to work, but any new TRA's or new collections for existing TRA's will
  use the new format. Solr will handle this invisibly, but any external code that
  attempted to predict collection names in TRA's will probably need adjustment.
