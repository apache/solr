title: Routed Aliases now use collection properties rather than core properties to
  identify collections that belong to the alias by default. This should be invisible
  and fully backwards compatible from within solr, and existing routed alias collections
  with core based properties will continue to work, but new collections created will
  not add a property to core.properties anymoore so any external code that inspected
  core.properties will not find the 'routedAliasName' key in new cores belonging to
  routed aliases.
