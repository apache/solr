title: Add FieldMutatingUpdateProcessorFactory subclasses Parse{Date,Integer,Long,Float,Double,Boolean}UpdateProcessorFactory.
  These factories have a default selector that matches all fields that either donâ€™t
  match any schema field, or are in the schema with the corresponding typeClass. If
  they see a value that is not a CharSequence, or can't parse the value, they leave
  it as is. For multi-valued fields, these processors will not convert any values
  unless all are first successfully parsed, or already are instances of the target
  class. Ordering the processors, e.g. [Boolean, Long, Double, Date] will allow e.g.
  values ["2", "5", "8.6"] to be left alone by the Boolean and Long processors, but
  then converted by the Double processor.
