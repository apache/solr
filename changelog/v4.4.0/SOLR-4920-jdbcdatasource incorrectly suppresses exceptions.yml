title: JdbcDataSource incorrectly suppresses exceptions when retrieving a connection
  from a JNDI context and falls back to trying to use DriverManager to obtain a connection.
  Additionally, if a SQLException is thrown while initializing a connection, such
  as in setAutoCommit(), the connection will not be closed.
