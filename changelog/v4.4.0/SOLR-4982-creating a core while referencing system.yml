title: Creating a core while referencing system properties looks like it loses files
  Actually, instanceDir, config, dataDir and schema are not dereferenced properly
  when creating cores that reference sys vars (e.g. &dataDir=${dir}). In the dataDir
  case in particular this leads to the index being put in a directory literally named
  ${dir} but on restart the sysvar will be properly dereferenced.
