title: persisting solr.xml is broken. More stringent testing of persistence fixed
  up a number of issues and several bugs with persistence. Among them are - don't
  persisting implicit properties - should persist zkHost in the &lt;solr&gt; tag (user's
  list) - reloading a core that has transient="true" returned an error. reload should
  load a transient core if it's not yet loaded. - No longer persisting loadOnStartup
  or transient core properties if they were not specified in the original solr.xml
  - Testing flushed out the fact that you couldn't swap a core marked transient=true
  loadOnStartup=false because it hadn't been loaded yet. - SOLR-4862, CREATE fails
  to persist schema, config, and dataDir - SOLR-4363, not persisting coreLoadThreads
  in &lt;solr&gt; tag - SOLR-3900, logWatcher properties not persisted - SOLR-4850,
  cores defined as loadOnStartup=true, transient=false can't be searched
