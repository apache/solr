title: Simplified DIH EntityProcessor API by moving logic for applying transformers
  and handling multi-row outputs from Transformers into an EntityProcessorWrapper
  class. The behavior of the method EntityProcessor#destroy has been modified to be
  called once per parent-row at the end of row. A new method EntityProcessor#close
  is added which is called at the end of import. A new method Context#getResolvedEntityAttribute
  is added which returns the resolved value of an entity's attribute. Introduced a
  DocWrapper which takes care of maintaining document level session variables.
