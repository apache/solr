title: Fix FieldType so setting an analyzer on a FieldType that doesn't expect it
  will generate an error. Practically speaking this means that Solr will now correctly
  generate an error on initialization if the schema.xml contains an analyzer configuration
  for a fieldType that does not use TextField.
