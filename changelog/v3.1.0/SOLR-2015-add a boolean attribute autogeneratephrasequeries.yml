title: Add a boolean attribute autoGeneratePhraseQueries to TextField. autoGeneratePhraseQueries="true"
  (the default) causes the query parser to generate phrase queries if multiple tokens
  are generated from a single non-quoted analysis string. For example WordDelimiterFilter
  splitting text:pdp-11 will cause the parser to generate text:"pdp 11" rather than
  (text:PDP OR text:11). Note that autoGeneratePhraseQueries="true" tends to not work
  well for non whitespace delimited languages.
