title: QueryElevationComponent only works if the uniqueKey field is implemented using
  StrField. In previous versions of Solr no warning or error would be generated if
  you attempted to use QueryElevationComponent, it would just fail in unexpected ways.
  This has been changed so that it will fail with a clear error message on initialization.
