title: deleteByQuery is ignored when deleteById is placed prior to deleteByQuery in
  a &lt;delete&gt;. Now both delete by id and delete by query can be specified at
  the same time as follows. &lt;delete&gt; &lt;id&gt;05991&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;06000&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;query&gt;office:Bridgewater&lt;/query&gt;&lt;query&gt;office:Osaka&lt;/query&gt;
  &lt;/delete&gt;
