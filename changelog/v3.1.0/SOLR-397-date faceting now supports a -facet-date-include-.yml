title: 'Date Faceting now supports a "facet.date.include" param for specifying when
  the upper & lower end points of computed date ranges should be included in the range.
  Legal values are: "all", "lower", "upper", "edge", and "outer". For backwards compatibility
  the default value is the set: [lower,upper,edge], so that all ranges between start
  and end are inclusive of their endpoints, but the "before" and "after" ranges are
  not.'
