title: The preferred Content-Type for XML was changed to application/xml. XMLResponseWriter
  now only delivers using this type; updating documents and analyzing documents is
  still supported using text/xml as Content-Type, too. If you have clients that are
  hardcoded on text/xml as Content-Type, you have to change them.
