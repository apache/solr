title: 'Use SLF4J logging API rather then JDK logging. The packaged .war file is shipped
  with a JDK logging implementation, so logging configuration for the .war should
  be identical to solr 1.3. However, if you are using the .jar file, you can select
  which logging implementation to use by dropping a different binding. See: http://www.slf4j.org/'
