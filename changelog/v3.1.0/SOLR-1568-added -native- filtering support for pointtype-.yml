title: Added "native" filtering support for PointType, GeohashField. Added LatLonType
  with filtering support too. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpatialSearch and the
  example. Refactored some items in Lucene spatial. Removed SpatialTileField as the
  underlying CartesianTier is broken beyond repair and is going to be moved.
