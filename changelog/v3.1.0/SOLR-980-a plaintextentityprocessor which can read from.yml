title: 'A PlainTextEntityProcessor which can read from any DataSource&lt;Reader&gt;
  and output a String. (Nathan Adams, Noble Paul via shalin) 100.SOLR-1003: XPathEntityprocessor
  must allow slurping all text from a given xml node and its children. (Noble Paul
  via shalin) 101.SOLR-1001: Allow variables in various attributes of RegexTransformer,
  HTMLStripTransformer and NumberFormatTransformer. (Fergus McMenemie, Noble Paul,
  shalin) 102.SOLR-989: DIH: Expose running statistics from the Context API. (Noble
  Paul, shalin) 103.SOLR-996: DIH: Expose Context to Evaluators. (Noble Paul, shalin)
  104.SOLR-783: DIH: Enhance delta-imports by maintaining separate last_index_time
  for each entity. (Jon Baer, Noble Paul via shalin) 105.SOLR-1033: Current entity''s
  namespace is made available to all DIH Transformers. This allows one to use an output
  field of TemplateTransformer in other transformers, among other things. (Fergus
  McMenemie, Noble Paul via shalin) 106.SOLR-1066: New methods in DIH Context to expose
  Script details. ScriptTransformer changed to read scripts through the new API methods.
  (Noble Paul via shalin) 107.SOLR-1062: A DIH LogTransformer which can log data in
  a given template format. (Jon Baer, Noble Paul via shalin) 108.SOLR-1065: A DIH
  ContentStreamDataSource which can accept HTTP POST data in a content stream. This
  can be used to push data to Solr instead of just pulling it from DB/Files/URLs.
  (Noble Paul via shalin) 109.SOLR-1061: Improve DIH RegexTransformer to create multiple
  columns from regex groups. (Noble Paul via shalin) 110.SOLR-1059: Special DIH flags
  introduced for deleting documents by query or id, skipping rows and stopping further
  transforms. Use $deleteDocById, $deleteDocByQuery for deleting by id and query respectively.
  Use $skipRow to skip the current row but continue with the document. Use $stopTransform
  to stop further transformers. New methods are introduced in Context for deleting
  by id and query. (Noble Paul, Fergus McMenemie, shalin) 111.SOLR-1076: JdbcDataSource
  should resolve DIH variables in all its configuration parameters. (shalin) 112.SOLR-1055:
  Make DIH JdbcDataSource easily extensible by making the createConnectionFactory
  method protected and return a Callable&lt;Connection&gt; object. (Noble Paul, shalin)
  113.SOLR-1058: DIH: JdbcDataSource can lookup javax.sql.DataSource using JNDI. Use
  a jndiName attribute to specify the location of the data source. (Jason Shepherd,
  Noble Paul via shalin) 114.SOLR-1083: A DIH Evaluator for escaping query characters.
  (Noble Paul, shalin) 115.SOLR-934: A MailEntityProcessor to enable indexing mails
  from POP/IMAP sources into a solr index. (Preetam Rao, shalin) 116.SOLR-1060: A
  DIH LineEntityProcessor which can stream lines of text from a given file to be indexed
  directly or for processing with transformers and child entities. (Fergus McMenemie,
  Noble Paul, shalin) 117.SOLR-1127: Add support for DIH field name to be templatized.
  (Noble Paul, shalin) 118.SOLR-1092: Added a new DIH command named ''import'' which
  does not automatically clean the index. This is useful and more appropriate when
  one needs to import only some of the entities. (Noble Paul via shalin) 119.SOLR-1153:
  DIH ''deltaImportQuery'' is honored on child entities as well (noble) 120.SOLR-1230:
  Enhanced dataimport.jsp to work with all DataImportHandler request handler configurations,
  rather than just a hardcoded /dataimport handler. (ehatcher) 121.SOLR-1235: disallow
  period (.) in DIH entity names (noble) 122.SOLR-1234: Multiple DIH does not work
  because all of them write to dataimport.properties. Use the handler name as the
  properties file name (noble) 123.SOLR-1348: Support binary field type in convertType
  logic in DIH JdbcDataSource (shalin) 124.SOLR-1406: DIH: Make FileDataSource and
  FileListEntityProcessor to be more extensible (Luke Forehand, shalin) 125.SOLR-1437:
  DIH: XPathEntityProcessor can deal with xpath syntaxes such as //tagname , /root//tagname'
