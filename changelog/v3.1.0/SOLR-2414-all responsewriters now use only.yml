title: All ResponseWriters now use only ServletOutputStreams and wrap their own Writer
  around it when serializing. This fixes the bug in PHPSerializedResponseWriter that
  produced wrong string length if the servlet container had a broken UTF-8 encoding
  that was in fact CESU-8 (see SOLR-1091). The system property to enable the CESU-8
  byte counting in PHPSerializesResponseWriters for broken servlet containers was
  therefore removed and is now ignored if set. Output is always UTF-8.
