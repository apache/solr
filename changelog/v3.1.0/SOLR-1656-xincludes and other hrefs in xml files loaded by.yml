title: 'XIncludes and other HREFs in XML files loaded by ResourceLoader are fixed
  to be resolved using the URI standard (RFC 2396). The system identifier is no longer
  a plain filename with path, it gets initialized using a custom URI scheme "solrres:".
  This scheme is resolved using a EntityResolver that utilizes ResourceLoader (org.apache.solr.common.util.SystemIdResolver).
  This makes all relative pathes in Solr''s config files behave like expected. This
  change introduces some backwards breaks in the API: Some config classes (Config,
  SolrConfig, IndexSchema) were changed to take org.xml.sax.InputSource instead of
  InputStream. There may also be some backwards breaks in existing config files, it
  is recommended to check your config files / XSLTs and replace all XIncludes/HREFs
  that were hacked to use absolute paths to use relative ones.'
