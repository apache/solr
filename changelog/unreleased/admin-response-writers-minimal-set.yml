title: Introduce minimal ADMIN_RESPONSE_WRITERS for admin/container-level requests. Admin requests now use a minimal set of 6 response writers (javabin, json, xml, prometheus, openmetrics, standard) instead of the full 14-writer DEFAULT_RESPONSE_WRITERS map. Core-specific requests continue to use ImplicitPlugins.json with ConfigOverlay support.

notes: |
  Admin/container-level requests (e.g., /admin/cores, /admin/collections) have no associated SolrCore
  and cannot use the core's response writer registry loaded from ImplicitPlugins.json. Previously,
  these requests used DEFAULT_RESPONSE_WRITERS (14 entries). Now they use ADMIN_RESPONSE_WRITERS (6 entries)
  containing only the formats actually needed by admin APIs:
  - javabin (SolrJ clients)
  - json (Admin UI)
  - xml (backward compatibility)
  - prometheus/openmetrics (metrics endpoint)
  - standard (alias for json)
  
  This provides clearer separation of concerns and better documentation of requirements. Core-specific
  requests are unaffected and continue to use the full ImplicitPlugins.json system with ConfigOverlay support.
  DEFAULT_RESPONSE_WRITERS remains available but is now deprecated for internal use.
