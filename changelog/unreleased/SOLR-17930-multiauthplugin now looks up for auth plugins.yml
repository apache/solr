title: MultiAuthPlugin now looks up for auth plugins configured with "xBasic" as scheme
  if "Basic" authentication used and no plugin with "Basic" scheme found. This allows
  the new UI to authenticate in browser without a credentials prompt being displayed.
  The MultiAuthPlugin can now also be configured with a single plugin.
