title: 'Terms facets with the JSON Facet API now defer calculating non-sorting stats
  until a second phase, after the top N facets are found. This improves performance
  proportional to the number of non-sorting statistics being calculated in addition
  to the number of buckets and domain documents. For Example: The facet request {type:terms,
  field:field1, facet:{x:"unique(field2)"}} saw a 7x improvement when field1 and 1M
  unique terms and field2 had 1000 unique terms.'
