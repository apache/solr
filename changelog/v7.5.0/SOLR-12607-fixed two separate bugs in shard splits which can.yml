title: Fixed two separate bugs in shard splits which can cause data loss. The first
  case is when using TLOG replicas only, the updates forwarded from parent shard leader
  to the sub-shard leader are written only in tlog and not the index. If this happens
  after the buffered updates have been replayed then the updates can never be executed
  even though they remain the transaction log. The second case is when synchronously
  forwarding updates to sub-shard leader fails and the underlying errors are not propagated
  to the client.
