title: Make it possible to co-locate replicas of multiple collections together in
  a node. A collection may be co-located with another collection during collection
  creation time by specifying a 'withCollection' parameter. It can also be co-located
  afterwards by using the modify collection API. The co-location guarantee is enforced
  regardless of future cluster operations whether they are invoked manually via the
  Collection API or by the Autoscaling framework.
