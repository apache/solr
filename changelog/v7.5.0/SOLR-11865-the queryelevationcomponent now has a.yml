title: The QueryElevationComponent now has a useConfiguredElevatedOrder setting. When
  multiple docs are elevated, this specifies whether their relative order should be
  the order in the configuration file or if not then should they be subject to whatever
  the sort criteria is. Additionally, QEC was extensively refactored to be more extensible.
