title: Allow nested child documents to be in field values of a SolrInputDocument as
  an alternative to add/get ChildDocuments off to the side. The latter is now referred
  to as "anonymous" child documents as opposed to "labelled" (by the field name).
  Anonymous child docs might be deprecated in the future. This is an internal change
  that should work for javabin/SolrJ; separate issues will address XML & JSON formats
  populating nested docs in this way. AddUpdateCommand and it's relationship with
  DirectUpdateHandler2 was reworked substantially.
