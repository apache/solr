title: Put an UpdateRequestProcessor-enforced soft-limit on the number of fields allowed
  in a core. The `NumFieldLimitingUpdateRequestProcessorFactory` limit may be adjusted
  by raising the factory's `maxFields` setting, toggled in and out of "warning-only"
  mode using the `warnOnly` setting, or disabled entirely by removing it solrconfig.xml.
  The limit is set at 1000 fields in the "_default" configset, but left in warning-only
  mode.
