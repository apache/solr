title: The Solr schema version has been increased to 1.7. Since schema version 1.7,
  all fields/fieldTypes that support docValues will have them enabled by default.
  This behavior can be reverted by setting 'docValues' parameter for a field or a
  field type to false, the default for schema versions 1.6 and below.
