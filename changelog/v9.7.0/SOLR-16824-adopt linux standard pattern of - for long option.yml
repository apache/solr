title: Adopt Linux standard pattern of -- for long option commands, and make all commands
  "kebab" formatting. I.e -zkHost is now -zk-host. The old parameters such as -zkHost
  continue to be supported in the 9.x line of Solr. -u is now used to specify user
  credentials everywhere, this only impacts the bin/solr assert commands "same user"
  check which has -u as the short form of --same-user.
