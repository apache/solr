title: facet.sort=index reported incorrect results for distributed search in a number
  of scenarios when facet.mincount&gt;0. This patch also adds some performance/algorithmic
  improvements when (facet.sort=count && facet.mincount=1 && facet.limit=-1) and when
  (facet.sort=index && facet.mincount&gt;0)
