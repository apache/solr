title: Add "top-level" DV implementation for {!terms} queries. This approach tends
  to be more efficient for queries with very large numbers of terms. The new implementation
  is used by default for method=docValuesTermsFilter terms queries that are searching
  500 or more terms. Users wishing to ignore this heuristic can choose the docValuesTermsFilterTopLevel
  or docValuesTermsFilterPerSegment methods directly.
