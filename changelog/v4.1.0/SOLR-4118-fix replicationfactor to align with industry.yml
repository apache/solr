title: Fix replicationFactor to align with industry usage. replicationFactor now means
  the total number of copies of a document stored in the collection (or the total
  number of physical indexes for a single logical slice of the collection). For example
  if replicationFactor=3 then for a given shard there will be a total of 3 replicas
  (one of which will normally be designated as the leader.)
