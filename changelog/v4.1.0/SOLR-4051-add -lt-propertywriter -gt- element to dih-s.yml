title: Add &lt;propertyWriter /&gt; element to DIH's data-config.xml file, allowing
  the user to specify the location, filename and Locale for the "data-config.properties"
  file. Alternatively, users can specify their own property writer implementation
  for greater control. This new configuration element is optional, and defaults mimic
  prior behavior. The one exception is that the "root" locale is default. Previously
  it was the machine's default locale.
