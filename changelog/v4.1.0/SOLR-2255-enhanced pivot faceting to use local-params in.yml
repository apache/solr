title: Enhanced pivot faceting to use local-params in the same way that regular field
  value faceting can. This means support for excluding a filter query, using a different
  output key, and specifying 'threads' to do facet.method=fcs concurrently. PivotFacetHelper
  now extends SimpleFacet and the getFacetImplementation() extension hook was removed.
