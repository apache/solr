title: Refactor PointField & TrieField to now have a common base class, NumericFieldType.
  The TrieField.TrieTypes and PointField.PointTypes are now consolidated to NumericFieldType.NumberType.
  This refactoring also fixes a bug whereby PointFields were not using DocValues for
  range queries for indexed=false, docValues=true fields.
