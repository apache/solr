title: string/text fields may now declare themselves as large="true" in the schema.
  Large fields are always lazy loaded and will only take up space in the document
  cache if the actual value is &lt; 512KB. This option requires "stored" and must
  not be multiValued. It's intended for fields that might have very large values so
  that they don't get cached in memory.
