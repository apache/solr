title: JMX metric "avgTimePerRequest" (and the corresponding metric in the metrics
  API for each handler) used to be a simple non-decaying average based on total cumulative
  time and the number of requests. New Codahale Metrics implementation applies exponential
  decay to this value, which heavily biases the average towards the last 5 minutes.
