title: Fix DIH's TestJdbcDataSource to work with Java 9 and other Java runtimes that
  do not use the same DriverManager implementation like Oracle's original one. The
  test now uses a fully implemented Driver instance returning a mock connection. The
  test also works correct now if other drivers were installed before test execution
  (e.g., through IDE).
