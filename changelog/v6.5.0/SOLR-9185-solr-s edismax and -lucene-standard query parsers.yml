title: 'Solr''s edismax and "Lucene"/standard query parsers will no longer split on
  whitespace before sending terms to analysis, if given the "sow=false" request param
  ("sow"=&gt;"split on whitespace"). This enables multi-term source synonyms to match
  at query-time using SynonymGraphFilterFactory; other analysis components will also
  now work at query time, e.g. ShingleFilterFactory. By default, and when the "sow=true"
  param is specified, these parsers'' behavior remains the same: queries will be split
  on whitespace before sending individual terms to analysis.'
