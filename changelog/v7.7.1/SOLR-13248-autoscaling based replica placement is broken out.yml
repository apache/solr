title: Autoscaling based replica placement is broken out of the box. Solr 7.5 enabled
  autoscaling based replica placement by default but in the absence of default cluster
  policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the same shard on the same
  node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these
  reasons, this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy'
  assignment policy that was the default until Solr 7.4.
