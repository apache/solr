title: Added pluggable cache support to DIH so that any Entity can be made cache-able
  by adding the "cacheImpl" parameter. Include "SortedMapBackedCache" to provide in-memory
  caching (as previously this was the only option when using CachedSqlEntityProcessor).
  Users can provide their own implementations of DIHCache for other caching strategies.
  Deprecate CachedSqlEntityProcessor in favor of specifing "cacheImpl" with SqlEntityProcessor.
  Make SolrWriter implement DIHWriter and allow the possibility of pluggable Writers
  (DIH writing to something other than Solr).
