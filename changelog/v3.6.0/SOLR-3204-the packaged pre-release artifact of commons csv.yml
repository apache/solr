title: The packaged pre-release artifact of Commons CSV used the original package
  name (org.apache.commons.csv). This created a compatibility issue as the Apache
  Commons team works toward an official release of Commons CSV. The source of Commons
  CSV was added under a separate package name to the Solr source code.
