title: Solr now uses Log4J 2.11 . The log4j configuration is now in log4j2.xml rather
  than log4j.properties files. This is a server side change only and clients using
  SolrJ won't need any changes. Clients can still use any logging implementation which
  is compatible with SLF4J. We now let log4j2 handle rotation of solr logs at startup,
  and bin/solr start scripts will no longer attempt this nor move existing console
  or GC logs into logs/archived either SOLR-12144
