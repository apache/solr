title: SolrMetric registries retained references to SolrCores when closed. A change
  of SolrMetricMAnager.registerGauge and SolrMetricProducer.initializeMetrics method
  signatures was required to fix it. Third party components may continue to use the
  old API but should be updated to avoid this bug
