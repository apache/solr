title: Remove the obsolete QueryWrapperFilter intermediate wrapper, which also removed
  some needless uses of SolrConstantScoreQuery as well. QWF since v5.4.0 sometimes
  needlessly internally executed and cached the query. Affects ExpandComponent, ChildDocTransformer,
  CurrencyFieldType, TermsQParser.
