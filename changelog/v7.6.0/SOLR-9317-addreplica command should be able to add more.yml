title: ADDREPLICA command should be able to add more than one replica to a collection,shard
  at a time. The API now supports 'nrtReplicas', 'tlogReplicas', 'pullReplicas' parameters
  as well 'createNodeSet' parameter. As part of this change, the CREATESHARD API now
  delegates placing replicas entirely to the ADDREPLICA command and uses the new parameters
  to add all the replicas in one API call.
