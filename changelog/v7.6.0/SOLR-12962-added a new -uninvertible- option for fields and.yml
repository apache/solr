title: Added a new 'uninvertible' option for fields and fieldtypes. This defaults
  to 'true' for backcompat allowing a FieldCache to be built for indexed fields as
  needed, but users are encouraged to set this to false (using docValues as needed)
  to reduce the risk of large fluxuations in heap size due to unexpected attempts
  to sort/facet/function on non-docValue fields.
