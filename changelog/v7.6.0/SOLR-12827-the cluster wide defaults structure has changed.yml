title: 'The cluster wide defaults structure has changed from {collectionDefaults:
  {nrtReplicas : 2}} to {defaults : {collection : {nrtReplicas : 2}}}. The old format
  continues to be supported and can be read from ZK as well as written using the V2
  set-obj-property syntax but it is deprecated and will be removed in Solr 9. We recommend
  that users change their API calls to use the new format going forward.'
