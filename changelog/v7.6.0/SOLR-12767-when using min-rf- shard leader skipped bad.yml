title: When using min_rf, shard leader skipped bad replicas instead of marking them
  for recovery, this could create inconsistencies between replicas of the same shard.
  min_rf parameter is now deprecated, and even if provided replicas that don't ack
  an update from the leader will be marked for recovery.
