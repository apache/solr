title: Autoscaling policy framework is now used as the default strategy to select
  the nodes on which new replicas or replicas of new collections are created. Previously,
  the maxShardsPerNode parameter was not allowed on collections when autoscaling policy
  was configured. Also if an autoscaling policy was configured then the default was
  to set an unlimited maxShardsPerNode automatically. Now the maxShardsPerNode parameter
  is always allowed during collection creation and maxShardsPerNode should be set
  correctly (if required) regardless of whether autoscaling policies are in effect
  or not. The default value of maxShardsPerNode continues to be 1 as before. It can
  be set to -1 during collection creation to fall back to the old behavior of unlimited
  maxShardsPerNode when using autoscaling policy.
