title: 'UninvertingReader wrapping is now a bit more lightweight: Does not create
  FieldInfo for fields that can''t be uninverted (saves mem) and can avoid wrapping
  the reader altogether if there''s nothing to uninvert. IndexSchema.getUninversionMap
  refactored to getUninversionMapper and no longer merges FieldInfos.'
