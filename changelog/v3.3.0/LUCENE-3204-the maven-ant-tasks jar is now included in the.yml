title: 'The maven-ant-tasks jar is now included in the source tree; users of the generate-maven-artifacts
  target no longer have to manually place this jar in the Ant classpath. NOTE: when
  Ant looks for the maven-ant-tasks jar, it looks first in its pre-existing classpath,
  so any copies it finds will be used instead of the copy included in the Lucene/Solr
  source tree. For this reason, it is recommeded to remove any copies of the maven-ant-tasks
  jar in the Ant classpath, e.g. under ~/.ant/lib/ or under the Ant installation''s
  lib/ directory.'
