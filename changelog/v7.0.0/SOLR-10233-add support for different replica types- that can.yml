title: 'Add support for different replica types, that can handle updates differently:
  - NRT: Writes updates to transaction log and indexes locally. Replicas of type “NRT”
  support NRT (soft commits) and RTG. Any NRT replica can become a leader. This was
  the only type supported in SolrCloud until now and it’s the default type. - TLOG:
  Writes to transaction log, but not to index, uses replication to copy segment files
  from the shard leader. Any TLOG replica can become leader (by first applying all
  local transaction log elements). If a replica is of type TLOG but is also the leader,
  it will behave as a NRT. This is exactly what was added in SOLR-9835 (non-realtime
  replicas), just the API and naming changes. - PULL: Doesn’t index or writes to transaction
  log, just replicates from the shard leader. PULL replicas can’t become shard leaders
  (i.e., if there are only PULL replicas in the collection at some point, updates
  will fail same as if there is no leaders, queries continue to work), so they don’t
  even participate in elections.'
