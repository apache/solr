title: 'Refinement for JSON Facet API: Adding refine:true to any terms facet will
  cause an additional distributed search phase (overlapped with field retrieval) that
  requests additional info for top facet buckets from shards that did not previously
  contribute to that bucket. This will correct counts (and other statistics) for those
  top buckets collected in the first phase.'
