title: Work around the static Lucene BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount that causes Solr's
  maxBooleanClauses setting behavior to be "last core wins". This patch sets BooleanQuery.maxClauseCount
  to its maximum value, thus disabling the global check, and replaces it with specific
  checks where desired via QueryUtils.build().
