title: 'JSON Facet API: When a field/terms facet will retrieve all buckets (i.e. limit:-1)
  and there are no nested facets, aggregations are computed in the first collection
  phase so that the second phase which would normally involve calculating the domain
  for the bucket can be skipped entirely, leading to large performance improvements.'
