title: Changed requestDispatcher's handleSelect to default to false, thus ignoring
  "qt". Simplified configs to not refer to handleSelect or "qt". Switch all tests
  that assumed true to assume false (added leading '/' in request handlers). Switch
  all tests referring to "standard" request handler to instead refer to "/select"
  with SearchHandler. Deprecated the old StandardRequestHandler.
