title: Data driven schema now indexes text field "foo" as both "foo" (text_general)
  and as "foo_str" (string) to facilitate both search and faceting. AddSchemaFieldsUpdateProcessor
  now has the ability to add a "copyField" to the type mappings, with an optional
  maxChars limitation. You can also define one typeMappings as default. This also
  solves issues SOLR-8495, SOLR-6966, and SOLR-7058
