title: The query parsers igain, significantTerms, and tlogit (used by streaming expressions
  by the same name) might throw a NullPointerException if the referenced field had
  no indexed data in some shards. The fix included an optimization to use Solr's cached
  AtomicReader instead of re-calculating.
