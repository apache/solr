title: 'SolrJ: The project is migrating away from the Apache HttpClient dependency
  in favor of Jetty''s client (supporting HTTP/2), to occur over the 9x releases.
  We deprecated HttpSolrClient and friends in favor of Http2SolrClient and equivalents.
  For SolrCloud, the former CloudSolrClient was renamed CloudLegacySolrClient (deprecated),
  and instead BaseCloudSolrClient was renamed to CloudSolrClient and given a Builder
  for the Jetty based HTTP/2 client.'
