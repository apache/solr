title: 'Metrics: Only SearchHandler and subclasses have "local" metrics now. It''s
  now tracked as if it''s another handler with a "[shard]" suffix, e.g. "/select[shard]".
  There are no longer ".distrib." named metrics; all metrics are assumed to be such
  except "[shard]". The default Prometheus exporter config splits that component to
  a new label named "internal". The sample Grafana dashboard now filters to include
  or exclude this.'
