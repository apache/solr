title: Modernize and clean up search results clustering module. This issue upgrades
  the clustering module to the new Carrot2 4.x line, dropping several CVE-prone dependencies
  along the way. The parameters and configuration of the module extensions have changed.
  The documentation in Solr ref guide has been rewritten from scratch to be up to
  date. Clustering code has been rewritten from scratch to work properly regardless
  of the mode (standalone, distributed). The API has been stripped of ancient, unused,
  interfaces and simplified.
