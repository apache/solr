title: 'Docker: Removed /var/solr initialization from the Dockerfile; depend on init_var_solr.sh
  instead. This leads to more consistent behavior no matter how /var/solr is mounted.
  * init_var_solr.sh is now invoked by docker-entrypoint.sh; not in a bunch of other
  places. * as before, you can set NO_INIT_VAR_SOLR=1 to short-circuit this. * init_var_solr.sh
  no longer echo''s anything. For verbosity, set VERBOSE=yes.'
