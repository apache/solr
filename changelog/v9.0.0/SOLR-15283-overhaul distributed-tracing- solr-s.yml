title: Overhaul distributed-tracing. Solr's "samplePercentage" is gone; tracing is
  either enabled and you always have trace IDs or it isn't, based on whether you configure
  a tracing plugin. Reporting of traces to a server like Zipkin is a configuration
  matter of the tracing plugin you use. The Jaeger plugin is now completely configurable
  via system properties or environment vars, not by values in solr.xml.
