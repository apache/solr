title: Added Solr adapters for Lucene 4's new spatial module. With SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType
  ("location_rpt" in example schema), it is possible to index a variable number of
  points per document (and sort on them), index not just points but any Spatial4j
  supported shape such as polygons, and to query on these shapes too. Polygons requires
  adding JTS to the classpath.
