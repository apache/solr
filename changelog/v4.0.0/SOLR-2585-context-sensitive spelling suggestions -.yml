title: Context-Sensitive Spelling Suggestions & Collations. This adds support for
  the "spellcheck.alternativeTermCount" & "spellcheck.maxResultsForSuggest" parameters,
  letting users receive suggestions even when all the queried terms exist in the dictionary.
  This differs from "spellcheck.onlyMorePopular" in that the suggestions need not
  consist entirely of terms with a greater document frequency than the queried terms.
