title: 'Core reload bugs: a reload always obtained a non-NRT searcher, which could
  go back in time with respect to the previous core''s NRT searcher. Versioning did
  not work correctly across a core reload, and update handler synchronization was
  changed to synchronize on core state since more than on update handler can coexist
  for a single index during a reload.'
