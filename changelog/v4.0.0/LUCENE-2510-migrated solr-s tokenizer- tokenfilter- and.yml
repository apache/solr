title: Migrated Solr's Tokenizer-, TokenFilter-, and CharFilterFactories to the lucene-analysis
  module. To add new analysis modules to Solr (like ICU, SmartChinese, Morfologik,...),
  just drop in the JAR files from Lucene's binary distribution into your Solr instance's
  lib folder. The factories are automatically made available with SPI.
