title: 'Spatial fields that used to require units=degrees like SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType
  (RPT) now take distanceUnits=degrees|kilometers|miles instead. It is applied to
  nearly all distance measurements involving the field: maxDistErr, distErr, d, geodist,
  score=distance|area|area2d. score now accepts these units as well. It does NOT affect
  distances embedded in WKT strings like BUFFER(POINT(200 10),0.2)).'
