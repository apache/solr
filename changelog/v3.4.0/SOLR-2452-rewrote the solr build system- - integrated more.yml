title: 'Rewrote the Solr build system: - Integrated more fully with the Lucene build
  system: generalized the Lucene build system and eliminated duplication. - Converted
  all Solr contribs to the Lucene/Solr conventional src/ layout: java/, resources/,
  test/, and test-files/&lt;contrib-name&gt;. - Created a new Solr-internal module
  named "core" by moving the java/, test/, and test-files/ directories from solr/src/
  to solr/core/src/. - Merged solr/src/webapp/src/ into solr/core/src/java/. - Eliminated
  solr/src/ by moving all its directories up one level; renamed solr/src/site/ to
  solr/site-src/ because solr/site/ already exists. - Merged solr/src/common/ into
  solr/solrj/src/java/. - Moved o.a.s.client.solrj.* and o.a.s.common.* tests from
  solr/src/test/ to solr/solrj/src/test/. - Made the solrj tests not depend on the
  solr core tests by moving some classes from solr/src/test/ to solr/test-framework/src/java/.
  - Each internal module (core/, solrj/, test-framework/, and webapp/) now has its
  own build.xml, from which it is possible to run module-specific targets. solr/build.xml
  delegates all build tasks (via &lt;ant dir="internal-module-dir"&gt; calls) to these
  modules'' build.xml files.'
