title: Ability to add cache=false to queries and query filters to avoid using the
  filterCache or queryCache. A cost may also be specified and is used to order the
  evaluation of non-cached filters from least to greatest cost . For very expensive
  query filters (cost &gt;= 100) if the query implements the PostFilter interface,
  it will be used to obtain a Collector that is checked only for documents that match
  the main query and all other filters. The "frange" query now implements the PostFilter
  interface.
