title: all Stream Evaluators in solrj.io.eval have been refactored to have a simplier
  and more robust structure. This simplifies and condenses the code required to implement
  a new Evaluator and makes it much easier for evaluators to handle differing data
  types (primitives, objects, arrays, lists, and so forth).
