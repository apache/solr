title: '''autoAddReplicas'' feature is ported to autoscaling framework. Existing users
  of this feature should not have to change anything. Note these changes: 1. Behaviour:
  Changing the autoAddReplicas property from disabled to enabled using MODIFYCOLLECTION
  API no longer replaces down replicas for the collection immediately. Instead, replicas
  are only added if a node containing them went down while autoAddReplicas was enabled.
  The params autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration and autoReplicaFailoverWorkLoopDelay
  are no longer used. 2. Deprecations: Enabling/disabling autoAddReplicas cluster
  wide with the API will be deprecated; use suspend/resume trigger APIs with name=''.auto_add_replicas''
  instead.'
