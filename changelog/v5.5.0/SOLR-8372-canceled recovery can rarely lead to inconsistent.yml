title: 'Canceled recovery can rarely lead to inconsistent shards: If a replica is
  recovering via index replication, and that recovery fails (for example if the leader
  goes down), and then some more updates are received (there could be a few left to
  be processed from the leader that just went down), and then that replica is brought
  down, it will think it is up-to-date when restarted.'
