title: Solr's default behavior when dealing with 'maxBooleanClauses' has changed to
  reduce the risk of exponential query expansion when dealing with pathological query
  strings. A default upper limit of 1024 clauses (The same default prior to Solr 7.0)
  is now enforced at the node level, and can be overridden in solr.xml. The identically
  named solrconfig.xml setting is still available for limiting the size of 'explicit'
  boolean query strings, but this per-collection limit is still ristricted by the
  upper-bound of the global limit in solr.xml. See SOLR-13336 for more details.
