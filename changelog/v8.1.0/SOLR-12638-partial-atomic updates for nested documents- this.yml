title: Partial/Atomic Updates for nested documents. This enables atomic updates for
  nested documents, without the need to supply the whole nested hierarchy (which would
  be overwritten if absent). This is done by fetching the whole document hierarchy,
  updating the specific doc in the path that is to be updated, removing the old document
  hierarchy and indexing the new one with the atomic update merged into it. Also,
  [child] Doc Transformer now works with RealTimeGet.
