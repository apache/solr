title: Added two new highlight parameters, hl.maxMultiValuedToMatch and hl.maxMultiValuedToExamine.
  maxMultiValuedToMatch stops looking for snippets after finding the specified number
  of matches, no matter how far into the multivalued field you've gone. maxMultiValuedToExamine
  stops looking for matches after the specified number of multiValued entries have
  been examined. If both are specified, the limit hit first stops the loop. Also this
  patch cuts down on the copying of the document entries during highlighting. These
  optimizations are probably unnoticeable unless there are a large number of entries
  in the multiValued field. Conspicuously, this will prevent the "best" match from
  being found if it appears later in the MV list than the cutoff specified by either
  of these params.
