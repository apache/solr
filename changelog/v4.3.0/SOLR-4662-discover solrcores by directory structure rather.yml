title: 'Discover SolrCores by directory structure rather than defining them in solr.xml.
  Also, change the format of solr.xml to be closer to that of solrconfig.xml. This
  version of Solr will ship the example in the old style, but you can manually try
  the new style. Solr 4.4 will ship with the new style, and Solr 5.0 will remove support
  for the old style. (Erick Erickson, Mark Miller) Additional Work: - SOLR-4347: Ensure
  that newly-created cores via Admin handler are persisted in solr.xml (Erick Erickson)
  - SOLR-1905: Cores created by the admin request handler should be persisted to solr.xml.
  Also fixed a problem whereby properties like solr.solr.datadir would be persisted
  to solr.xml. Also, cores that didn''t happen to be loaded were not persisted.'
