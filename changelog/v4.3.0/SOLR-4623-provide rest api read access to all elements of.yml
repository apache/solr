title: Provide REST API read access to all elements of the live schema. Add a REST
  API request to return the entire live schema, in JSON, XML, and schema.xml formats.
  Move REST API methods from package org.apache.solr.rest to org.apache.solr.rest.schema,
  and rename base functionality REST API classes to remove the current schema focus,
  to prepare for other non-schema REST APIs. Change output path for copyFields and
  dynamicFields from "copyfields" and "dynamicfields" (all lowercase) to "copyFields"
  and "dynamicFields", respectively, to align with all other REST API outputs, which
  use camelCase.
