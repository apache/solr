title: You are encouraged to try out the UnifiedHighlighter by setting hl.method=unified
  and report feedback. It might become the default in 7.0. It's more efficient/faster
  than the other highlighters, especially compared to the original Highlighter. That
  said, some options aren't supported yet. It will get more features in time, especially
  with your input. See HighlightParams.java for a listing of highlight parameters
  annotated with which highlighters use them. hl.useFastVectorHighlighter is now considered
  deprecated in lieu of hl.method=fastVector.
