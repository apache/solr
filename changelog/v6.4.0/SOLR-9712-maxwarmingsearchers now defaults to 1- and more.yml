title: maxWarmingSearchers now defaults to 1, and more importantly commits will now
  block if this limit is exceeded instead of throwing an exception (a good thing).
  Consequently there is no longer a risk in overlapping commits. Nonetheless users
  should continue to avoid excessive committing. Users are advised to remove any pre-existing
  maxWarmingSearchers entries from their solrconfig.xml files.
