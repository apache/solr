title: FieldType has a new getSetQuery() method that can take a set of terms and create
  a more efficient query (such as TermsQuery). The solr query parser has been changed
  to use this method when appropriate. The parser also knows when it is being used
  to parse a filter and will create TermsQueries from large lists of normal terms
  or numbers, resulting in a query that will execute faster. This also acts to avoid
  BooleanQuery maximum clause limit. Query parsing itself has also been optimized,
  resulting in less produced garbage and 5-7% better performance.
