title: Added UnifiedSolrHighlighter, a highlighter adapter for Lucene's UnifiedHighlighter.
  The adapter is a derivative of the PostingsSolrHighlighter, supporting mostly the
  same parameters with some differences. Introduced "hl.method" parameter which can
  be set to original|fastVector|postings|unified to pick the highlighter at runtime
  without the need to modify solrconfig from the default configuration. hl.useFastVectorHighlighter
  is now considered deprecated in lieu of hl.method=fastVector.
