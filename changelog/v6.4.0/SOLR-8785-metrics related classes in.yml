title: 'Metrics related classes in org.apache.solr.util.stats have been removed in
  favor of the dropwizard metrics library. Any custom plugins using these classes
  should be changed to use the equivalent classes from the metrics library. As part
  of this, the following changes were made to the output of Overseer Status API: *
  The "totalTime" metric has been removed because it is no longer supported * The
  metrics "75thPctlRequestTime", "95thPctlRequestTime", "99thPctlRequestTime" and
  "999thPctlRequestTime" in Overseer Status API have been renamed to "75thPcRequestTime",
  "95thPcRequestTime" and so on for consistency with stats output in other parts of
  Solr. * The metrics "avgRequestsPerMinute", "5minRateRequestsPerMinute" and "15minRateRequestsPerMinute"
  have been replaced by corresponding per-second rates viz. "avgRequestsPerSecond",
  "5minRateRequestsPerSecond" and "15minRateRequestsPerSecond" for consistency with
  stats output in other parts of Solr.'
