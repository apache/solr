title: JSON Facet API - field faceting on a multi-valued string field without docValues
  (i.e. UnInvertedField implementation), but with a prefix or with a sort other than
  count, resulted in incorrect results. This has been fixed, and facet.prefix support
  for facet.method=uif has been enabled.
