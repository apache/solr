title: IgnoreLargeDocumentProcessorFactory now supports a "permissive" mode, where
  it logs and skips offending documents but doesn't short-circuit the entire batch
  or return a 4xx error. This mode can be enabled by setting the `permissiveMode`
  boolean option to `true` in your solrconfig.xml's IgnoreLargeDocumentProcessorFactory
  declaration.
