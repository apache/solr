title: Certain Jetty "server" jars (jetty-util, jetty-io, etc.) are no longer duplicated
  between server/lib and WEB-INF/lib. All shared jars now live in server/lib/ext.
  By default, Jetty does not allow these jars to be shared by the Jetty server and
  the web-app (Solr). In order to accomplish this, explicit exclusions have been added
  to server/contexts/solr-jetty-context.xml that allow these "server" jars to be shared.
  Solr Core also no longer contains the JettySolrRunner (now living in the testing
  framework), removing the need for Jetty Server dependencies in solr-core.
