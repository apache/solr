title: Java will now crash the Solr process on OOME and create a crash file that logs
  the cause. This capability is now also present on Windows. Before, with bin/solr
  but not bin/solr.cmd, Solr would execute a script that killed the Solr pid, leaving
  a very small time window where Solr would continue to execute in an unpredictable
  state.
