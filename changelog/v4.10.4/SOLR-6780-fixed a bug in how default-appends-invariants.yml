title: 'Fixed a bug in how default/appends/invariants params were affecting the set
  of all "keys" found in the request parameters, resulting in some key=value param
  pairs being duplicated. This was noticeably affecting some areas of the code where
  iteration was done over the set of all params: - literal.* in ExtractingRequestHandler
  - facet.* in FacetComponent - spellcheck.[dictionary name].* and spellcheck.collateParam.*
  in SpellCheckComponent - olap.* in AnalyticsComponent'
type: fixed
