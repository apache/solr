title: Make SolrCell easier to use out of the box. Also improves "/browse" to display
  rich-text documents correctly, along with facets for author and content_type. With
  the new "content" field, highlighting of body is supported. See also SOLR-3672 for
  easier posting of a whole directory structure.
