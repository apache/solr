title: 'Improve logging by adding node name in MDC in SolrCloud mode and adding MDC
  to all thread pools. A new MDCAwareThreadPoolExecutor is introduced and usages of
  Executors#newFixedThreadPool, #newSingleThreadExecutor, #newCachedThreadPool as
  well as ThreadPoolExecutor directly is now forbidden in Solr. MDC keys are now exposed
  in thread names automatically so that a thread dump can give hints on what the thread
  was doing. Uncaught exceptions thrown by tasks in the pool are logged along with
  submitter''s stack trace.'
