title: Refactor SolrDispatchFilter to extract all Solr specific implementation detail
  to HttpSolrCall and also extract methods from within the current SDF.doFilter(..)
  logic making things easier to manage. HttpSolrCall converts the processing to a
  3-step process i.e. Construct, Init, and Call so the context of the request would
  be available after Init and before the actual call operation.
