title: Seeding bucket versions from index when the firstSearcher event fires has a
  race condition that leads to an infinite wait on VersionInfo's ReentrantReadWriteLock
  because the read-lock acquired during a commit cannot be upgraded to a write-lock
  needed to block updates; solution is to move the call out of the firstSearcher event
  path and into the SolrCore constructor.
