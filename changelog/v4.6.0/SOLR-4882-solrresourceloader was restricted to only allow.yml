title: 'SolrResourceLoader was restricted to only allow access to resource files below
  the instance dir. The reason for this is security related: Some Solr components
  allow to pass in resource paths via REST parameters (e.g. XSL stylesheets, velocity
  templates,...) and load them via resource loader. For backwards compatibility, this
  security feature can be disabled by a new system property: solr.allow.unsafe.resourceloading=true'
