title: Solr now offers `SolrRequest` implementations for a subset of its v2 APIs.
  These implementations are experimental and should be used with caution, but may
  be preferable to their v1 counterparts in some circumstances as they are generated
  and more likely to remain up-to-date with future API changes.
