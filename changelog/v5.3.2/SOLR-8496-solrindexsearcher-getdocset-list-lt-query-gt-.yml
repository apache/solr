title: SolrIndexSearcher.getDocSet(List&lt;Query&gt;) incorrectly included deleted
  documents when all of the queries were uncached (or there was no filter cache).
  This caused multi-select faceting (including the JSON Facet API) to include deleted
  doc counts when the remaining non-excluded filters were all uncached. This bug was
  first introduced in 5.3.0
