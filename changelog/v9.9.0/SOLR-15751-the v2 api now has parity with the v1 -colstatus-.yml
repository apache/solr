title: The v2 API now has parity with the v1 "COLSTATUS" and "segments" APIs, which
  can be used to fetch detailed information about specific collections or cores. Collection
  information can be fetched by a call to `GET /api/collections/collectionName`, and
  core information with a call to `GET /api/cores/coreName/segments`.
