title: 'SolrJ: If Http2SolrClient.Builder.withHttpClient is used, (and it''s used
  more in 9.8, shifted from deprecated Apache HttpClient based clients), settings
  affecting HttpClient construction cannot be customized; an IllegalStateException
  will now be thrown if you try. The connection timeout cannot be customized, but
  idle & request timeouts can be. Callers (various places in Solr) no longer customize
  the connection timeout.'
