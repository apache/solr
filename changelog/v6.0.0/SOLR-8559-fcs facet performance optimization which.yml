title: FCS facet performance optimization which significantly speeds up processing
  when terms are high cardinality and the matching docset is small. When facet minCount
  &gt; 0 and the number of matching documents is small (or 0) this enhancement prevents
  considering terms which have a 0 count. Also includes change to move to the next
  non-zero term value when selecting a segment position.
