title: Speed up creation of filters from term range queries (i.e. non-numeric range
  queries) and use the filter cache for term range queries that are part of larger
  queries. Some observed speedups were up to 2.5x for production of filters, and up
  to 10x for query evaluation with embedded term range queres that resulted in filter
  cache hits.
