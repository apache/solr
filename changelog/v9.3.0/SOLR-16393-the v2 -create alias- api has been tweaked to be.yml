title: 'The v2 "create alias" API has been tweaked to be more intuitive. The format
  of the request body has changed slightly: the "create-alias" command specifier has
  been removed, the "name" field for individual routers has been renamed to "type",
  and the routers themselves are now always grouped into a list. Additionally the
  v2 API has moved to the new path `POST /api/aliases`.'
