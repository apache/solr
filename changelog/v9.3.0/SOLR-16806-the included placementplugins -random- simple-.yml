title: The included PlacementPlugins (Random, Simple, MinimizeCores and Affinity)
  now all implement the OrderedNodePlacementPlugin, which provides the implementation
  for computePlacements() and computeBalancing(). Each implementing PlacementPlugin
  provides a way of weighting Solr Nodes, and the OrderedNodePlacement plugin then
  uses the weights to decide the optimal strategy for placing new replicas or balancing
  existing replicas.
