title: Solr's v2 "logging" APIs have been tweaked slightly to be more intuitive. The
  single v2 endpoint that existing previously (GET /api/node/logging) has been split
  into several different APIs. Logger levels can be fetched or modified at `GET /api/node/logging/levels`
  and `PUT /api/node/logging/levels`, respectively. Log messages can be returned from
  a "listener" at `GET /api/node/logging/messages`. And the threshold for the log
  "listener" can be modified with `PUT /api/node/logging/messages/threshold`.
