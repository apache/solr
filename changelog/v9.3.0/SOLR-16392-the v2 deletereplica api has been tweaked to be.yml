title: 'The v2 deletereplica API has been tweaked to be more intuitive: single replicas
  deletion now uses `DELETE /api/collections/cName/shards/sName/replicas/rName`, deletion
  of multiple relicas in a single shard uses `DELETE /api/collections/cName/shards/sName/replicas?count=123`,
  and deletion of multiple replicas from all shards now uses `PUT /api/collections/cName/scale
  {"count": 123"}`'
