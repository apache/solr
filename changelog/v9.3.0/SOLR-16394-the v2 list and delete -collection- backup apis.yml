title: 'The v2 list and delete (collection) backup APIs have been tweaked to be more
  intuitive: backup listing now uses `GET /api/backups/bName/versions`, backup deletion
  by ID now uses `DELETE /api/backups/bName/versions/1`, backup deletion by recency
  now uses `DELETE /api/backups/bName/versions?retainLatest=3`, and index-file "garbage
  collection" now uses `PUT /api/backups/backupName/purgeUnused`'
