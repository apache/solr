title: When querying with the `_route_` or `shards.preference` parameter and if there
  are multiple replicas for a collection on the receiving node, there was sometimes
  an extra HTTP hop or the non-intended replica may receive the request. SolrJ will
  now form the URL directly to the intended replica of the collection (and not the
  collection itself).
