title: Add property to control the deletion of unknown cores. The default setting
  is to not delete unknown cores. This is a change to behaviour introduced in Solr
  7.3.1 by SOLR-12066. To continue using the previous behaviour, Solr can be started
  with the system property `solr.deleteUnknownCores` set to `true`.
