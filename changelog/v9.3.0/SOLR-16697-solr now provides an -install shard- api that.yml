title: Solr now provides an "Install Shard" API that allows users who have built (per-shard)
  indices offline to import them into SolrCloud shards. The API is available at `POST
  /api/collections/collName/shards/shardName/install` (v2), or at `GET /solr/admin/collections?action=INSTALLSHARDDATA`
  (v1).
