title: Allow setting the a CookieStore implementation in Http2SolrClient. When Cookies
  are not needed, this can be set to `org.eclipse.jetty.util.HttpCookieStore.Empty`,
  which avoids some of the processing that happens in the default `java.net.InMemoryCookieStore`.
  Solr can also be started with the system property `solr.http.disableCookies` set
  to `true`, so that the internal clients that Solr uses to communicate between nodes
  use `HttpCookieStore.Empty`.
