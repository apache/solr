title: Add support for multi-select faceting by allowing filters to be tagged and
  facet commands to exclude certain filters. This patch also added the ability to
  change the output key for facets in the response, and optimized distributed faceting
  refinement by lowering parsing overhead and by making requests and responses smaller.
