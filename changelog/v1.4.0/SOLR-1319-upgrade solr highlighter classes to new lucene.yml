title: Upgrade Solr Highlighter classes to new Lucene Highlighter API. This upgrade
  has resulted in a back compat break in the DefaultSolrHighlighter class - getQueryScorer
  is no longer protected. If you happened to be overriding that method in custom code,
  overide getHighlighter instead. Also, HighlightingUtils#getQueryScorer has been
  removed as it was deprecated and backcompat has been broken with it anyway.
