title: firstSearcher and newSearcher can now be identified via the CommonParams.EVENT
  (evt) parameter in a request. This allows a RequestHandler or SearchComponent to
  know when a newSearcher or firstSearcher event happened. QuerySenderListender is
  the only implementation in Solr that implements this, but outside implementations
  may wish to. See the AbstractSolrEventListener for a helper method.
