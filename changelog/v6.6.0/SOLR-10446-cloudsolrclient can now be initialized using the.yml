title: CloudSolrClient can now be initialized using the base URL of a Solr instance
  instead of ZooKeeper hosts. This is possible through the use of newly introduced
  HttpClusterStateProvider. To fetch a list of collection aliases, this depends on
  LISTALIASES command, and hence this way of initializing CloudSolrClient would not
  work if you have collection aliases on older versions of Solr server that doesn't
  support LISTALIASES.
