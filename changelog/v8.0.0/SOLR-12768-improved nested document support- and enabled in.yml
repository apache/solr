title: Improved nested document support, and enabled in the default schema with the
  presence of _nest_path_. When this field is present, certain things happen automatically.
  An internal URP is automatically used to populate it. The [child] (doc transformer)
  will return a hierarchy with relationships; no params needed. The relationship path
  is indexed for use in queries (can be disabled if not needed). Also, child documents
  needn't provide a uniqueKey value as Solr will supply one automatically by concatenating
  a path to that of the parent document's key.
