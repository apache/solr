title: Due to LUCENE-8563, the BM25Similarity formula no longer includes the (k1+1)
  factor in the numerator This gives a lower absolute score but doesn't affect ordering,
  as this is a constant factor which is the same for every document. Use LegacyBM25SimilarityFactory
  if you need the old 6.x/7.x scoring. See also upgrade notes
