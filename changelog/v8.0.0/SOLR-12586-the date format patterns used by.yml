title: The date format patterns used by ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (present
  in "schemaless mode") are now interpreted by Java 8's java.time.DateTimeFormatter
  instead of Joda Time. The pattern language is very similar but not the same. Typically,
  simply update the pattern by changing an uppercase 'Z' to lowercase 'z' and that's
  it. For the current recommended set of patterns in schemaless mode, see "Schemaless
  Mode" in the ref guide, or simply examine the default configSet. Also note that
  the set of patterns (formats) here have expanded from before to subsume those patterns
  previously handled by the "extract" contrib (Solr Cell / Tika).
