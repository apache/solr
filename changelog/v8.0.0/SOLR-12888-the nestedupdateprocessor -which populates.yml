title: The NestedUpdateProcessor (which populates internal fields for nested child
  docs) is now auto-registered to run immediately prior to RunUpdateProcessor. If
  the schema has no _nest_*_ fields then it's a no-op. RunUpdateProcessorFactory looks
  up a special/internal URP chain "_preRun_" which is implicitly defined but could
  be defined by an app for customization if desired.
