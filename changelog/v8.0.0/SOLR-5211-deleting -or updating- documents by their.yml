title: Deleting (or updating) documents by their uniqueKey is now scoped to only consider
  root documents, not child/nested documents. Thus a delete-by-id won't work on a
  child doc (no-op), and an attempt to update a child doc by providing a new doc with
  the same ID would add a new doc (probably erroneous). Both these actions were and
  still are problematic. In-place-updates are safe though. If you want to delete certain
  child documents and if you know they don't themselves have nested children then
  you must do so with a delete-by-query technique.
