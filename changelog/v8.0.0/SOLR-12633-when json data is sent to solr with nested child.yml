title: When JSON data is sent to Solr with nested child documents split using the
  "split" parameter, the child docs will now be associated to their parents by the
  field/label string used in the JSON instead of anonymously. Most users probably
  won't notice the distinction since the label is lost any way unless special fields
  are in the schema. This choice used to be toggleable with an internal/expert "anonChildDocs"
  parameter flag which is now gone.
