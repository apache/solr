title: If you explicitly use BM25SimilarityFactory in your schema, the absolute scoring
  will be lower due to SOLR-13025. But ordering of documents will not change in the
  normal case. Use LegacyBM25SimilarityFactory if you need to force the old 6.x/7.x
  scoring. Note that if you have not specified any similarity in schema or use the
  default SchemaSimilarityFactory, then LegacyBM25Similarity is automatically selected
  for 'luceneMatchVersion' &lt; 8.0.0. See also explanation in Reference Guide chapter
  "Other Schema Elements".
