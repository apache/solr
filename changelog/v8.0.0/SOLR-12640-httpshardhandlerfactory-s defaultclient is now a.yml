title: HttpShardHandlerFactory's defaultClient is now a Http2SolrClient (previous
  HttpSolrClient). This new client does not support 'maxConnections','maxConnectionsPerHost'
  parameters. LBHttpSolrClient.Req and LBHttpSolrClient.Rsp are marked as deprecated,
  uses LBSolrClient.Req and LBSolrClient.Rsp instead.
