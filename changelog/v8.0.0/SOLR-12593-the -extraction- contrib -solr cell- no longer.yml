title: The "extraction" contrib (Solr Cell) no longer does any date parsing, and thus
  no longer has the "date.formats" configuration. To ensure date strings are properly
  parsed, use ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (an URP) commonly registered with
  the name "parse-date" in "schemaless mode".
