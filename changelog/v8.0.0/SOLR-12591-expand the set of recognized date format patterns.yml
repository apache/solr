title: Expand the set of recognized date format patterns of schemaless mode to subsume
  those handled by the "extract" contrib (Solr Cell / Tika). This is primarily a change
  in configuration of the default configSet for more patterns, but also included enabling
  "lenient" parsing in ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory. The default locale was
  changed from ROOT to en_US since well-known patterns assume this locale.
