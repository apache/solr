title: 'The default replica placement strategy used in Solr has been reverted to the
  ''legacy'' policy used by Solr 7.4 and previous versions. This is due to multiple
  bugs in the autoscaling based replica placement strategy that was made default in
  Solr 7.5 which causes multiple replicas of the same shard to be placed on the same
  node in addition to the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet parameters being ignored.
  Although the default has changed, autoscaling will continue to be used if a cluster
  policy or preference is specified or a collection level policy is in use. The default
  replica placement strategy can be changed to use autoscaling again by setting a
  cluster property: curl -X POST -H ''Content-type:application/json'' --data-binary
  '' { "set-obj-property": { "defaults" : { "cluster": { "useLegacyReplicaAssignment":false
  } } } }'' http://$SOLR_HOST:$SOLR_PORT/api/cluster'
