title: use Lucene updateDocument, deleteDocuments methods. This removes the maxBufferedDeletes
  parameter added by SOLR-310 as Lucene now manages the deletes. This provides slightly
  better indexing performance and makes overwrites atomic, eliminating the possibility
  of a crash causing duplicates.
