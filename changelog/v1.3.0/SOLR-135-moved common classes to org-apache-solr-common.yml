title: 'Moved common classes to org.apache.solr.common and altered the build scripts
  to make two jars: apache-solr-1.3.jar and apache-solr-1.3-common.jar. This common.jar
  can be used in client code; It does not have lucene or junit dependencies. The original
  classes have been replaced with a @Deprecated extended class and are scheduled to
  be removed in a later release. While this change does not affect API compatibility,
  it is recommended to update references to these deprecated classes.'
