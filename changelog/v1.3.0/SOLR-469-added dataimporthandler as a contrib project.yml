title: Added DataImportHandler as a contrib project which makes indexing data from
  Databases, XML files and HTTP data sources into Solr quick and easy. Includes API
  and implementations for supporting multiple data sources, processors and transformers
  for importing data. Supports full data imports as well as incremental (delta) indexing.
  See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DataImportHandler for more details.
