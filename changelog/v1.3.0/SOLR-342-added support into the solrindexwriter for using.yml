title: 'Added support into the SolrIndexWriter for using several new features of the
  new LuceneIndexWriter, including: setRAMBufferSizeMB(), setMergePolicy(), setMergeScheduler.
  Also, added support to specify Lucene''s autoCommit functionality (not to be confused
  with Solr''s similarily named autoCommit functionality) via the &lt;luceneAutoCommit&gt;
  config. item. See the test and example solrconfig.xml &lt;indexDefaults&gt; section
  for usage. Performance during indexing should be significantly increased by moving
  up to 2.3 due to Lucene''s new indexing capabilities. Furthermore, the setRAMBufferSizeMB
  makes it more logical to decide on tuning factors related to indexing. For best
  performance, leave the mergePolicy and mergeScheduler as the defaults and set ramBufferSizeMB
  instead of maxBufferedDocs. The best value for this depends on the types of documents
  in use. 32 should be a good starting point, but reports have shown up to 48 MB provides
  good results. Note, it is acceptable to set both ramBufferSizeMB and maxBufferedDocs,
  and Lucene will flush based on whichever limit is reached first.'
