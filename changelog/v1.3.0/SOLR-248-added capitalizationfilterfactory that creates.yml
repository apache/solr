title: 'Added CapitalizationFilterFactory that creates tokens with normalized capitalization.
  This filter is useful for facet display, but will not work with a prefix query.
  (ryan) SOLR-468: Change to the semantics to keep the original token, not the token
  in the Map. Also switched to use Lucene''s new reusable token capabilities.'
