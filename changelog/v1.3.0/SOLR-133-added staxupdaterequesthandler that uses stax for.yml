title: Added StaxUpdateRequestHandler that uses StAX for XML parsing. This implementation
  has much better error checking and lets you configure a custom UpdateRequestProcessor
  that can selectively process update requests depending on the request attributes.
  This class will likely replace XmlUpdateRequestHandler.
