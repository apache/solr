title: Added RawResponseWriter and ShowFileRequestHandler. This returns config files
  directly. If AdminHandlers are configured, this will be added automatically. The
  jsp files /admin/get-file.jsp and /admin/raw-schema.jsp have been deprecated. The
  deprecated &lt;admin&gt;&lt;gettableFiles&gt; will be automatically registered with
  a ShowFileRequestHandler instance for backwards compatibility.
