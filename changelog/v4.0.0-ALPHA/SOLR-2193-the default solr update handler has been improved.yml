title: 'The default Solr update handler has been improved so that it uses fewer locks,
  keeps the IndexWriter open rather than closing it on each commit (ie commits no
  longer wait for background merges to complete), works with SolrCore to provide faster
  ''soft'' commits, and has an improved API that requires less instanceof special
  casing. (Mark Miller, Robert Muir) Additional Work: - SOLR-2697: commit and autocommit
  operations don''t reset DirectUpdateHandler2.numDocsPending stats attribute.'
