title: added MultiTermAwareComponent to the various classes to allow automatic lowercasing
  for multiterm queries (wildcards, regex, prefix, range, etc). You can now optionally
  specify a "multiterm" analyzer in our schema.xml, but Solr should "do the right
  thing" if you don't specify &lt;analyzer type="multiterm"&gt;
