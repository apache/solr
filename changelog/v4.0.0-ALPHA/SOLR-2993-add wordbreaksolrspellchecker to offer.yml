title: 'Add WordBreakSolrSpellChecker to offer suggestions by combining adjacent query
  terms and/or breaking terms into multiple words. This spellchecker can be configured
  with a traditional checker (ie: DirectSolrSpellChecker). The results are combined
  and collations can contain a mix of corrections from both spellcheckers.'
