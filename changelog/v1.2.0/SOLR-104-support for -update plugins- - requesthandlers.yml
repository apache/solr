title: Support for "Update Plugins" -- RequestHandlers that want access to streams
  of data for doing updates. ContentStreams can come from the raw POST body, multi-part
  form data, or remote URLs. Included in this change is a new SolrDispatchFilter that
  allows RequestHandlers registered with names that begin with a "/" to be accessed
  using a URL structure based on that name.
