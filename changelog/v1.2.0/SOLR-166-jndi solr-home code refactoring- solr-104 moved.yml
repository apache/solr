title: JNDI solr.home code refactoring. SOLR-104 moved some JNDI related code to the
  init method of a Servlet Filter - according to the Servlet Spec, all Filter's should
  be initialized prior to initializing any Servlets, but this is not the case in at
  least one Servlet Container (Resin). This "bug fix" refactors this JNDI code so
  that it should be executed the first time any attempt is made to use the solr.home
  dir.
