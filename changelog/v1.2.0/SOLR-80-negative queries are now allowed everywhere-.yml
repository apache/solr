title: Negative queries are now allowed everywhere. Negative queries are generated
  and cached as their positive counterpart, speeding generation and generally resulting
  in smaller sets to cache. Set intersections in SolrIndexSearcher are more efficient,
  starting with the smallest positive set, subtracting all negative sets, then intersecting
  with all other positive sets.
