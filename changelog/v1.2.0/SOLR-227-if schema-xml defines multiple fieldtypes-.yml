title: If schema.xml defines multiple fieldTypes, fields, or dynamicFields with the
  same name, a severe error will be logged rather then quietly continuing. Depending
  on the &lt;abortOnConfigurationError&gt; settings, this may halt the server. Likewise,
  if solrconfig.xml defines multiple RequestHandlers with the same name it will also
  add an error.
