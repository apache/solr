title: 'Support GeoJSON response writer and general spatial formatting. Adding &wt=geojson&geojson.field=&lt;your
  geometry field&gt; Will return a FeatureCollection for each SolrDocumentList and
  a Feature with the requested geometry for each SolrDocument. The requested geometry
  field needs to either extend AbstractSpatialFieldType or store a GeoJSON string.
  This also adds a [geo] DocumentTransformer that can return the Shape in a variety
  of formats: &fl=[geo f=&lt;your geometry field&gt; w=(GeoJSON|WKT|POLY)] The default
  format is GeoJSON. For information on the supported formats, see: https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/blob/master/FORMATS.md
  To return the FeatureCollection as the root element, add ''&omitHeader=true"'
