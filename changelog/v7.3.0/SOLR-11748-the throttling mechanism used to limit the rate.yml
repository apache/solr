title: The throttling mechanism used to limit the rate of autoscaling events processed
  has been removed. This deprecates the 'actionThrottlePeriodSeconds' setting in the
  set-properties Autoscaling API which is now a no-op. Use the 'triggerCooldownPeriodSeconds'
  instead to pause event processing.
