title: A new mechanism is introduced in SOLR-11702 to maintain consistency in SolrCloud
  between leader and replicas. This mechanism lets Solr know whether a replica is
  in-sync with the leader or not, even when the leader is not live. If all the replicas
  who participate in the leader election are out-of-sync with previous leader, the
  election will pause until a timeout (named "leaderVoteWait") before allowing an
  out-of-sync replica to become leader. Note that the new leader still needs to contains
  more updates than any other active replicas in the same shard. Therefore by increasing
  leaderVoteWait will increase the consistency (over availability) of the system.
  The default value of leaderVoteWait is 180,000 ms (3 minutes) and it can be adjusted
  in the "solrcloud" section of the solr.xml
