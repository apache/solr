title: The behaviour of the autoscaling system has been modified to pause all triggers
  from execution between the start of actions and end of cool down period. The triggers
  will be resumed after the cool down period expires. Previously, the cool down period
  was a fixed period started after actions for a trigger event complete and during
  this time, all triggers continued to run but any events were rejected to be tried
  later.
