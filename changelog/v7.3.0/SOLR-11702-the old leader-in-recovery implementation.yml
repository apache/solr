title: The old Leader-In-Recovery implementation (SOLR-5495) is now deprecated and
  replaced. Solr will support rolling upgrades from old 7.x versions of Solr to future
  7.x releases until the last release of the 7.x major version. This means in order
  to upgrade to Solr 8 in the future, you must be on Solr 7.3 or higher.
