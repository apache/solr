title: Starting a query string with local-params {!myparser ...} is used to switch
  the query parser to another, and is intended for use by Solr system developers,
  not end users doing searches. To reduce negative side-effects of unintended hack-ability,
  we've limited the cases that local-params will be parsed to only contexts in which
  the default parser is "lucene" or "func". So if defType=edismax then q={!myparser
  ...} won't work. In that example, put the desired query parser into defType. Another
  example is if deftype=edismax then hl.q={!myparser ...} won't work for the same
  reason. In that example, either put the desired query parser into hl.qparser or
  set hl.qparser=lucene. Most users won't run into these cases but some will and must
  change. If you must have full backwards compatibility, use luceneMatchVersion=7.1.0
  or something earlier.
