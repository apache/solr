title: The edismax parser by default no longer allows subqueries that specify a Solr
  parser using either local-params, or the older _query_ magic field trick. For example
  {!prefix f=myfield v=enterp} or _query_:"{!prefix f=myfield v=enterp}" are not supported
  by default anymore. If you want to allow power-users to do this, set uf=* _query_
  or some other value that includes _query_. If you must have full backwards compatibility,
  use luceneMatchVersion=7.1.0 or something earlier.
