title: SPLITSHARD implements a new splitByPrefix option that takes into account the
  actual document distribution when using compositeIds. Document distribution is calculated
  using the "id_prefix" field (if it exists) containing just the compositeId prefixes,
  or directly from the indexed "id" field otherwise.
