title: Users who have written test cases that extend SolrTestCaseJ4 may see NullPointerExceptions
  if their tests directly reference both SolrTestCaseJ4.initCoreDataDir and SolrTestCaseJ4.deleteCore().
  This change in behavior is due to a bug fix in deleteCore() to ensure the dataDir
  is properly reset in tests that call initCore()/deleteCore() multiple times in a
  given test (class). initCoreDataDir is now deprecated, and users are encouraged
  to use SolrTestCaseJ4.initAndGetDataDir() in it's place. See SOLR-13664 for more
  details.
