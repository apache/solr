Once users submit a query, Solr provides a number of options for how to present the results.

Features like facets, grouping, collapsing, and clustering provide ways to group similar results together.

Highlighting shows users their query terms in context with surrounding text, helping them decide if a document "matches" their query.

Solr offers several ways to get results, or control how "pages" of results are returned to your client.
