SolrCloud is Solr's solution for fault tolerant and high availability clusters.
It provides central coordination of cluster activities and configurations and automatic load balancing and failover.

ZooKeeper is a critical component of SolrCloud, used to manage shard and replica locations, as well as document and query routing.
