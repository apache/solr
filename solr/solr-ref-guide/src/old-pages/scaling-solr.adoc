Solr supports large implementations by providing two distinct options for multi-node clusters.

The section *<<cluster-types.adoc#,Solr Cluster Types>>* describes the two main approaches available for scaling.

Both approaches share the ability to distribute parts of an index across multiple servers, a process called _sharding_.
This allows for an index that is larger than any one server can host and maintain reasonable performance.

A second process called _replication_ is also shared by both approaches.
This allows for copying the index (in whole or as shards) across multiple servers, and provides query volume distribution.

The differences between the approaches are then how each cluster is managed and what features are available to you.
