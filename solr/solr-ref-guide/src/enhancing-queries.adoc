Solr provides many options for assisting users with their queries.

These options allow you to show users alternate spellings for their search terms, or provide suggestions for terms while they type.

Re-ranking provides an ability to show documents in an order based on a query that may be more complex than the user's query.
This forms the basis of Solr's Learning to Rank functionality, which can re-rank documents based on a machine-learned model.

The Tagger request handler provides basic named entity recognition functionality.

Finally, if you want to understand the terms in your index or get statistics from terms in the index, those options are covered here also.
