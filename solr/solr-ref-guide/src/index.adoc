Welcome to Apache Solr(TM), the open source solution for search and analytics.

Solr is the fast open source search platform built on Apache Lucene(TM) that provides scalable indexing and search, as well as faceting, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.
Solr and Lucene are managed by the http://www.apache.org/[Apache Software Foundation].

This Reference Guide is the official Solr documentation, written and published by Lucene/Solr committers.
