The Luke Request Handler offers programmatic access to the information provided on the xref:schema-browser-screen.adoc[] page of the Admin UI.
It is modeled after https://github.com/apache/lucene/tree/releases/lucene/{dep-version-lucene}/lucene/luke[Luke], the Lucene Index Browser.
It is an implicit handler, so you don't need to define it in `solrconfig.xml`.

The Luke Request Handler accepts the following parameters:

`show`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: `all`
|===
+
The data about the index to include in the response.
Options are `schema`, `index`, `doc`, `all`.
* `all` returns all fields and high level details about the index.
* `index` returns the high level details about the index without all fields.
* `schema` returns details about the `schema` plus the `index` data.
* `doc` works in conjunction with `docId` or `id` parameters and returns details about a specific document plus the `index` data.

`id`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: none
|===
+
Get a document using the `uniqueKeyField` specified in the schema.

`docId`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: none
|===
+
Get a document using a Lucene documentID.

`fl`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: none
|===
+
Limit the returned values to a set of fields.
This is useful if you want to increase the `numTerms` and don't want a massive response.

`numTerms`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: `10`
|===
+
The number of top terms for each field.

`includeIndexFieldFlags`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: `true`
|===
+
Choose whether `/luke` should return the index-flags for each field.
Fetching and returning the index-flags for each field in the index has non-zero cost, and can slow down requests to `/luke`.

`distrib`::
+
[%autowidth,frame=none]
|===
|Optional |Default: `false`
|===
+
When set to `true` in SolrCloud mode, the handler aggregates results from all shards in the collection.
Additive index metrics (`numDocs`, `maxDoc`, `deletedDocs`, `segmentCount`) are summed across shards.
Field types and schema flags are validated for consistency across shards.
Per-shard index details and per-field detailed statistics are returned under a `shards` key.

== LukeRequestHandler Examples

All of the examples in this section assume you are running the "techproducts" Solr example:

[source,bash]
----
bin/solr start -e techproducts
----

To return summary information about the index:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?numTerms=0

To return schema details about the index:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?show=schema

To drill into a specific field `manu`, then you drop the `show` parameter and add the `fl` parameter:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?fl=manu

To see the specifics of a document using the Solr uniqueKeyField field:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?fl=manu&id=TWINX2048-3200PRO

Alternatively, to work through the Lucene native id:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?fl=manu&docId=0

From SolrJ, you can access /luke using the {solr-javadocs}/solrj/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/request/LukeRequest.html[`LukeRequest`] object.

== Distributed Mode (SolrCloud)

When running in SolrCloud, the Luke handler can aggregate results from all shards in a collection by setting `distrib=true`.
By default, `distrib` is `false` and the handler inspects only the local shard's index.

To get a collection-wide view:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?distrib=true&numTerms=0

To get detailed field statistics across all shards for a specific field:

[source,text]
http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/admin/luke?distrib=true&fl=manu

=== Response Structure

In distributed mode, the response contains:

* `index` -- Merged additive metrics summed across all shards: `numDocs`, `maxDoc`, `deletedDocs`, `segmentCount`.
* `fields` -- Merged field metadata. For each field: `type`, `schema` flags, `index` flags, and `dynamicBase` are validated to be consistent across shards. The `docs` count is summed. Per-field detailed statistics (`topTerms`, `distinct`, `histogram`) are _not_ included at this level.
* `schema` -- Schema information from the first responding shard (identical across shards sharing the same configset).
* `info` -- Static info from the first responding shard.
* `shards` -- Per-shard details, ordered lexicographically by shard address. Each entry contains:
** `index` -- Full index info for that shard (including `directory`, `segmentsFile`, `version`, `current`, `hasDeletions`, `lastModified`, `userData`).
** `fields` -- Only present when `fl` triggers detailed statistics. Contains per-field `topTerms`, `distinct`, and `histogram` from that shard.

=== Merge Semantics

Field `type`, `schema` flags, `index` flags, and `dynamicBase` are validated for consistency across shards.
If a mismatch is detected, the handler returns an error identifying the field, the conflicting values, and the shard addresses involved.

Per-field detailed statistics (`topTerms`, `distinct`, `histogram`) are not merged across shards.
These statistics are shard-local and appear in each shard's entry under the `shards` key.
For cross-shard term-level aggregation, use Solr's xref:query-guide:faceting.adoc[faceting API] which provides refinement and distributed aggregation.
