== Solr 10 Upgrade Planning

// TODO add similar text that previous releases have at this spot.

=== SolrJ

Starting in 10, the Maven POM for SolrJ does not refer to SolrJ modules like ZooKeeper.  If you require such functionality, you need to add additional dependencies.

=== Deprecation removals

* The `jaegertracer-configurator` module, which was deprecated in 9.2, is removed. Users should migrate to the `opentelemetry` module.

* `OpenTracing` libraries were removed and replaced with `OpenTelemetry` libraries. Any Java agents providing `OpenTracing` tracers will no longer work. Telemetry tags `http.status_code` and `http.method` have been deprecated, newer version of the tags have been added to the span data: `http.response.status_code`, `http.request.method`.

* The `analytics` module, which was deprecated in 9.2, is removed.

* The sysProp `-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern`, which allows users to provide a pattern to match sysProps that should be redacted for sensitive information,
has been removed. Please use `-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps` or the envVar `SOLR_HIDDEN_SYS_PROPS` instead.

* The `<hiddenSysProps>` solr.xml element under `<metrics>` has been removed. Instead use the `<hiddenSysProps>` tag under `<solr>`, which accepts a comma-separated string.
Please see `-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern`, which allows users to provide a pattern to match sysProps that should be redacted for sensitive information,
has been removed. Please use `-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps` or the envVar `SOLR_HIDDEN_SYS_PROPS` instead.
