== How do I persist Solr data and config?

Solr's Docker image is pre-configured with container path `/var/solr/` as a https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/[volume].
What this means is that all index data, log files and other variable data will be
persisted on the Docker host, even if you remove the container instance.

== How can I mount a host directory as a data volume?

By default Solr's volume is persisted in Docker's default storage location on the host.
On Linux systems this is `/var/lib/docker/volumes`. This is the recommended way to
store Solr's data. You have flexibility to use a bind mount host folder as well:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 8983:8983 -v $(pwd)/myData:/var/solr/ solr:9-slim
----

But this is both dependent on the host operating system and may run into different kind
of file system permission issues.

== Can I use volumes with SOLR_HOME?

While you could re-define `SOLR_HOME` inside the container, we instead recommend you
to use the existing `SOLR_HOME` defined at `/var/solr/`, see above. You can give the
volume a meaningful name instead of the auto generated hash, example name `solrData`:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -p 8983:8983 -v solrData:/mysolrhome solr:9-slim
----

== Can I run ZooKeeper and Solr clusters under Docker?

Yes. You can simply start your Solr containers in "Cloud mode", pointing
them to a xref:zookeeper-ensemble.adoc[Zookeeper Ensemble].

For local development, using a single zookeeper container is enough.
Please consult the https://hub.docker.com/_/zookeeper[Zookeeper docker image] for details.

For production purposes, we discourage rolling your own Zookeeper orchestration,
as there are many pitfalls. Instead, use a well-supported container orchestrator
with support for Solr and Zookeeper. For Kubernetes, we provide the
https://solr.apache.org/operator/[Solr Operator] sub project.
There are also 3rd party Helm charts available.

== How can I run ZooKeeper and Solr with Docker Compose?

See the xref:solr-in-docker.adoc#docker-compose[docker compose example].

== How can I get rid of "shared memory" warnings on Solr startup?

When starting the docker image you typically see these log lines:

[source,text]
----
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Failed to reserve shared memory. (error = 1)
----

If your set up can run without huge pages or you do not require it, the least-friction way to
remove this warning is to disable large paging in the JVM via the environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
SOLR_OPTS=-XX:-UseLargePages
----

In your Solr Admin UI, you will see listed under the JVM args both the original `-XX:+UseLargePages`
set by the `GC_TUNE` environment variable and further down the list the overriding `-XX:-UseLargePages` argument.

== I'm confused about the different invocations of Solr -- help?

The different invocations of the Solr docker image can look confusing, because the name of the image is "solr" and the Solr command is also "solr", and the image interprets various arguments in special ways.
Let's illustrate the various invocations:

To run an arbitrary command in the image:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr date
----

Here "solr" is the name of the image, and "date" is the command.
This does not invoke any Solr functionality.

To run the Solr server:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr
----

Here "solr" is the name of the image, and there is no specific command, so the image defaults to run the "solr" command with "-f" to run it in the foreground.

To run the Solr server with extra arguments:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr -h myhostname
----

This is the same as the previous one, but an additional argument is passed.
The image will run the "solr" command with "-f -h myhostname".

To run solr as an arbitrary command:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr solr zk --help
----

Here the first "solr" is the image name, and the second "solr" is the "solr" command.
The image runs the command exactly as specified; no "-f" is implicitly added.
The container will print help text, and exit.

If you find this visually confusing, it might be helpful to use more specific image tags, and specific command paths.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr bin/solr start -f -h myhostname
----

Finally, the Solr docker image offers several commands that do some work before then invoking the Solr server, like "solr-precreate" and "solr-demo".
See the README.md for usage.
These are implemented by the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script, and must be passed as the first argument to the image.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr solr-demo
----

It's important to understand an implementation detail here.
The Dockerfile uses `solr-foreground` as the `CMD`, and the `docker-entrypoint.sh` implements that by by running "solr -f".
So these two are equivalent:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr
docker run -it solr solr-foreground
----

whereas:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it solr solr -f
----

is slightly different: the "solr" there is a generic command, not treated in any special way by `docker-entrypoint.sh`.
In particular, this means that the `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` mechanism is not applied.
So, if you want to use `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, then you must use one of the other two invocations.
You also need to keep that in mind when you want to invoke solr from the bash command.
For example, this does NOT run `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it -v $PWD/set-heap.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/set-heap.sh \
    solr bash -c "echo hello; solr -f"
----

but this does:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -it $PWD/set-heap.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/set-heap.sh \
    solr bash -c "echo hello; /opt/docker-solr/scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh solr-foreground"
----
