== Ruby

JSON is the preferred interchange format for Ruby users.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'net/http'
require 'json'

h = Net::HTTP.new('localhost', 8983)
http_response = h.get('/solr/techproducts/select?q=iPod&wt=json')

# Parse the JSON response
rsp = JSON.parse(http_response.body)

puts 'Number of matches = ' + rsp['response']['numFound'].to_s

# Print out the name field for each returned document
rsp['response']['docs'].each do |doc|
  puts 'Name field = ' + doc['name']
end
----

You can even skip the `wt=json` as it's the default writer type.
