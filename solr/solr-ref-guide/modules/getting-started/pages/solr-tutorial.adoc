This tutorial covers getting Solr up and running, ingesting a variety of data sources into Solr collections,
and getting a feel for the Solr administrative and search interfaces.

The tutorial is organized into three sections that each build on the one before it.
The xref:tutorial-techproducts.adoc[first exercise] will ask you to start Solr, create a collection, index some basic documents, and then perform some searches.

The xref:tutorial-films.adoc[second exercise] works with a different set of data, and explores requesting facets with the dataset.

The xref:tutorial-diy.adoc[third exercise] encourages you to begin to work with your own data and start a plan for your implementation.

Finally, we'll introduce <<Spatial Queries,spatial search>> and show you how to get your Solr instance back into a clean state.

== Before You Begin

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need...

// TODO possibly remove this system requirements or only replace the link
. To meet the {solr-javadocs}/SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.html[system requirements]
. An Apache Solr release http://solr.apache.org/downloads.html[download].
This tutorial is designed for Apache Solr {solr-docs-version}.

For best results, please run the browser showing this tutorial and the Solr server on the same machine so tutorial links will correctly point to your Solr server.

== Unpack Solr

Begin by unzipping the Solr release and changing your working directory to the subdirectory where Solr was installed.
For example, with a shell in UNIX, Cygwin, or MacOS:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes+"]
----
~$ ls solr*
solr-{solr-full-version}.tgz

~$ tar -xzf solr-{solr-full-version}.tgz

~$ cd solr-{solr-full-version}/
----

If you'd like to know more about Solr's directory layout before moving to the first exercise, see the section xref:deployment-guide:installing-solr.adoc#directory-layout[Directory Layout] for details.


== Spatial Queries

Solr has sophisticated geospatial support, including searching within a specified distance range of a given location (or within a bounding box), sorting by distance, or even boosting results by the distance.

Some of the example techproducts documents we indexed in Exercise 1 have locations associated with them to illustrate the spatial capabilities.
To reindex this data, see xref:tutorial-techproducts.adoc[Exercise 1].

To learn more about Solr's spatial capabilities, see the section xref:query-guide:spatial-search.adoc[].

== Wrapping Up

If you've run the full set of commands in this quick start guide you have done the following:

* Launched Solr into SolrCloud mode, two nodes, two collections including shards and replicas
* Indexed several types of files
* Used the Schema API to modify your schema
* Opened the admin console, used its query interface to get results
* Opened the /browse interface to explore Solr's features in a more friendly and familiar interface

Nice work!

== Cleanup

As you work through this tutorial, you may want to stop Solr and reset the environment back to the starting point.
The following command line will stop Solr and remove the directories for each of the two nodes that were created all the way back in Exercise 1:

[source,bash]
----
bin/solr stop -all ; rm -Rf example/cloud/
----

== Where to next?

This Guide will be your best resource for learning more about Solr.

Solr also has a robust community made up of people happy to help you get started.
