Solr is the open source solution for search and analytics.

A fast open source search platform built on Apache Lucene(TM), Solr provides scalable indexing and search, as well as faceting, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.
Solr is managed by the http://www.apache.org/[Apache Software Foundation].

This Reference Guide is the official Solr documentation, written and published by Solr committers.
