The `solrconfig.xml` file is the configuration file with the most parameters affecting Solr itself.

While configuring Solr, you'll work with `solrconfig.xml` often, either directly or via the xref:config-api.adoc[] to create "configuration overlays" (`configoverlay.json`) to override the values in `solrconfig.xml`.

In `solrconfig.xml`, you configure important features such as:

* request handlers, which process the requests to Solr, such as requests to add documents to the index or requests to return results for a query

* listeners, processes that "listen" for particular query-related events; listeners can be used to trigger the execution of special code, such as invoking some common queries to warm-up caches

* the Request Dispatcher for managing HTTP communications

* the Admin Web interface

* parameters related to replication and duplication when not running in SolrCloud mode

The `solrconfig.xml` file is located in the `conf/` directory for each collection.
Several well-commented example files can be found in the `server/solr/configsets/` directories demonstrating best practices for many different types of installations.

Some `solrconfig.xml` aspects are documented in other sections.
See xref:libs.adoc#lib-directives-in-solrconfig[lib directives in SolrConfig], which can be used for both Plugins and Resources.
