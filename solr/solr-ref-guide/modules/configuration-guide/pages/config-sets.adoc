Configsets are a set of configuration files used in a Solr installation: `solrconfig.xml`, the schema, and xref:resource-loading.adoc[resources] like language files, `synonyms.txt`, and others.

Such configuration, _configsets_, can be named and then referenced by collections or cores, allowing you to share them to avoid duplication.

Solr ships with two example configsets located in `server/solr/configsets`, which can be used as a base for your own.
These example configsets are named `_default` and `sample_techproducts_configs`.

== Configsets in User-Managed Clusters or Single-Node Installations

If you are using Solr in a user-managed cluster or a single-node installation, configsets are managed on the filesystem.

Each Solr core can have it's very own configset located beneath it in a `<instance_dir>/conf/` dir.
Here, it is not named or shared and the word _configset_ isn't found.
In Solr's early years, this was _the only way_ it was configured.

To create a named configset, add a new directory under the configset base directory.
The configset will be identified by the name of this directory.
Then add a `conf/` directory containing the configuration you want to share.
The structure should look something like this:

[source,bash]
----
/<configSetBaseDir>
    /configset1
        /conf
            /managed-schema.xml
            /solrconfig.xml
    /configset2
        /conf
            /managed-schema.xml
            /solrconfig.xml
----

The default base directory is `$SOLR_HOME/configsets`.
This path can be configured with the `configSetBaseDir` parameter in `solr.xml` (see xref:configuring-solr-xml.adoc[] for details).

To create a new core using a configset, pass `configSet` as one of the core properties.
For example, if you do this via the CoreAdmin API:

[.dynamic-tabs]
--

[example.tab-pane#v1use-configset]
====
[.tab-label]*V1 API*

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/admin/cores?action=CREATE&name=mycore&instanceDir=path/to/instance&configSet=configset2
----
====

[example.tab-pane#v2use-configset]
====
[.tab-label]*V2 API*

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "create":[{
    "name": "mycore",
    "instanceDir": "path/to/instance",
    "configSet": "configSet2"}]}'
    http://localhost:8983/api/cores

== Configsets in SolrCloud Clusters

In SolrCloud, it's critical to understand that configsets are stored in ZooKeeper _and not_ the file system.
Solr's `_default` configset is uploaded to ZooKeeper on initialization.
This and a couple of example configsets remain on the file system but Solr does not use them unless they are used with a new collection.

When you create a collection in SolrCloud, you can specify a named configset.
If you don't, then the `_default` will be copied and given a unique name for use by the new collection.

A configset can be uploaded to ZooKeeper either via the xref:configsets-api.adoc[] or more directly via xref:deployment-guide:solr-control-script-reference.adoc#upload-a-configuration-set[`bin/solr zk upconfig`].
The Configsets API has some other operations as well, and likewise, so does the CLI.

To upload a file to a configset already stored on ZooKeeper, you can use xref:deployment-guide:solr-control-script-reference.adoc#copy-between-local-files-and-zookeeper-znodes[`bin/solr zk cp`].

CAUTION: By default, ZooKeeper's file size limit is 1MB.
If your files are larger than this, you'll need to either xref:deployment-guide:zookeeper-ensemble.adoc#increasing-the-file-size-limit[increase the ZooKeeper file size limit] or store them xref:libs.adoc#lib-directives-in-solrconfig[on the filesystem] of every node in a cluster.
