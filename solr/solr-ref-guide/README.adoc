This is the source for the Solr Reference Guide.

Raw content is stored in Asciidoc (`.adoc`) formatted files in the `modules/` directory.

To build the Ref Guide, run `./gradlew buildLocalSite`.
This will build the HTML files and validate that page references and internal links work properly.
You can find the home page of the generated site under `build/site/index.html`

See the `../../dev-docs/ref-guide` directory for information about editing and publishing the Ref Guide.

To ignore the Ref Guide steps when running gradle `assemble` or `check`, use either `-Prefguide.include=false` or `SOLR_REF_GUIDE_INCLUDE=false`.

If you want to test any changes for the Site UI files in `ui-src`, then use either `-Prefguide.buildLocalUI=true` or `SOLR_REF_GUIDE_BUILD_LOCAL_UI=true` when building the local or official site.

In order to build the official ref guide, run `./gradlew buildOfficialSite`. It will also be built under `build/site/`.
Note, this will not include any local changes to the ref guide, just what is published to git.
By default it will not include prerelase versions (the `main` and `branch_*x` branches), just the release versions (i.e. `branch_x_y`).
You can include all prerelease versions by including `-Prefguide.official.includePrereleaseVersions=true` or `SOLR_REF_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_INCLUDE_PRERELEASE=true` when building the official ref guide.
This is the option that is used when generating the nightlies refGuide release.
