This is the source for the Solr Reference Guide.

Raw content is stored in Asciidoc (`.adoc`) formatted files in the `modules/` directory.

To build the Ref Guide, run `./gradlew buildLocalSite`.
This will build the HTML files and validate that page references and internal links work properly.
You can find the home page of the generated site under `build/site/index.html`

See the `../../dev-docs/ref-guide` directory for information about editing and publishing the Ref Guide.

To ignore the Ref Guide steps when running gradle `assemble` or `check`, use either `-Prefguide.include=false` or `SOLR_REF_GUIDE_INCLUDE=false`.

In order to build the official ref guide, run `./gradlew buildOfficialSite`. It will also be built under `build/site/`.
Note, this will not include any local changes to the ref guide, just what is published to git.
By default it will not include prerelase versions (the `main` and `branch_*x` branches), just the release versions (i.e. `branch_x_y`).
You can include all prerelease versions by including `-Prefguide.official.includePrereleaseVersions=true` or `SOLR_REF_GUIDE_OFFICIAL_INCLUDE_PRERELEASE=true` when building the official ref guide.
This is the option that is used when generating the nightlies refGuide release.

**WARNING: NEVER run the "setOfficialAntoraYaml" task yourself. This is a job the release manager does as a part of the release process.
The dependency versions in the antora.yml will be updated at release time, it is not meant to be kept up to date between releases.**

== Changing the UI Bundle

Antora uses a `ui-bundle` to create a website out of the asciidoctor pages.
We use the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/[Default Antora UI] with overrides given in the `ui-src/` directory.

If you want to test any changes for the Site UI files in `ui-src/`, then use either `-Prefguide.buildLocalUI=true` or `SOLR_REF_GUIDE_BUILD_LOCAL_UI=true` when building the local or official site locally.
If you commit these changes to the `main` branch, then you must run a https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Solr/job/Solr-reference-guide-ui-bundle/[Jenkins Job] to update this file in the nightlies server.
Once you run this job, you need to run the jenkins job to rebuild the ref-guide as well.
That job is run nightly, so you could also just wait.

If you want to update, add or delete any file in `ui-src/`, please comment in-place that you are making a change.
If you are changing a file that already exists in the default UI, but not in `ui-src/`, download the file from the default UI repo to the correct directory under `ui-src/` first.

You can find examples throughout the existing files in the directory.
Without these comments it will be extremely hard for us to rebase our local versions of the files with the upstream default Antora UI when the time comes.
