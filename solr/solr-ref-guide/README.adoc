This is the source for the Solr Reference Guide.

Raw content is stored in Asciidoc (`.adoc`) formatted files in the `src/` directory.

To build the Ref Guide, simply run `./gradlew checkSite`.
This will build the HTML files and validate that page references and internal links work properly.

See the `../../dev-docs/ref-guide` directory for information about editing and publishing the Ref Guide.
