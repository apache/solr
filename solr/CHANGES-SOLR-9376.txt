Upgrade Notes
----------------------

* `[xml]` raw value DocTransformer: The response format for field values serialized
  as raw XML (via the `[xml]` raw value DocTransformer and `wt=xml`) has changed.
  Previously, values were dropped in directly as top-level child elements of each
  `<doc>`, obscuring associated field names and yielding inconsistent `<doc>`
  structure. This is changed with SOLR-9376, and raw values are now wrapped in a
  `<raw name="field_name">[...]</raw>` element at the top level of each `<doc>` (or
  within an enclosing `<arr name="field_name"><raw>[...]</raw></arr>` element for
  multi-valued fields). Existing clients that parse field values serialized in this
  way will need to be updated accordingly.

Improvements
----------------------
* SOLR-9376: Raw value DocTransformers (`[xml]`, `[json]`, `[geo w=GeoJSON]`) now work
  in a distributed/SolrCloud context (Michael Gibney)
