   * The {@link FieldRenamer} interface should be implemented by any {@link TransformerFactory}

   * SolrParams, SolrQueryRequest)} (with the latter method overridden to throw {@link
   * UnsupportedOperationException}).
   *
   * <p>{@link DocTransformer}s returned via {@link #create(String, SolrParams, SolrQueryRequest,
   * Map, Set)} will be added in a second pass, allowing simplified logic in {@link
   * TransformerFactory#create(String, SolrParams, SolrQueryRequest)} for non-renaming factories.
   *
   * <p>{@link #create(String, SolrParams, SolrQueryRequest, Map, Set)} must implement extra logic
   * to be aware of preceding field renames, and to make subsequent {@link FieldRenamer}
   * transformers aware of its own field renames.
   *
   * <p>It is harmless for a {@link DocTransformer} that does _not_ in practice rename fields to be
   * returned from a factory that implements this interface (e.g., for conditional renames?); but
   * doing so opens the possibility of {@link #create(String, SolrParams, SolrQueryRequest, Map,
   * Set)} being called _after_ fields have been renamed, so such implementations must still check
   * whether the field with which they are concerned has been renamed ... and if it _has_, must copy
   * the field back to its original name. This situation also demonstrates the motivation for
   * separating the creation of {@link DocTransformer}s into two phases: an initial phase involving
   * no field renames, and a subsequent phase that implement extra logic to properly handle field
   * renames.
