#  * The audience is end-users and administrators, not committers.
#  * Be short and focused on the user impact, nevertheless multiple sentences is fine!
#  * For technical/geeky details, prefer the commit message instead of changelog

# type:
#  `added` for new features/improvements, opt-in by the user typically documented in the ref guide
#  `changed` for improvements; not opt-in
#  `fixed` for improvements that are deemed to have fixed buggy behavior
#  `deprecated` for marking things deprecated
#  `removed` for code removed
#  `dependency_update` for updates to dependencies
#  `other` for anything else, like large/significant refactorings, build changes,
#    test infrastructure, or documentation.
#    Most such changes are too small/minor to bother with a changelog entry.

# Reference issues as `SOLR-12345` or GitHub `PR#123`.
