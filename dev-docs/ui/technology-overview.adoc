= Technology Overview
:toc: left

This document lists information about the technologies used in the UI module.

== Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. It is designed to be
fully interoperable with Java, making it an excellent choice for UI and
server-side development.

If you are new to Kotlin, it is strongly recommended to browse and go through the
https://kotlinlang.org/[language documentation]. Since the UI module makes use of Kotlin's
Multiplatform capabilities, you should also have a look at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html[Kotlin Multiplatform].

=== Coroutines

Kotlin Coroutines provide a powerful and flexible way to manage asynchronous programming.
They allow developers to write code that is sequential in nature but non-blocking under the hood,
enabling efficient and straightforward concurrent programming. Coroutines simplify tasks such as
making network requests, processing large datasets, or handling multiple user interactions
simultaneously. They are integrated into the Kotlin language through libraries like
kotlinx.coroutines.

To get started with Kotlin Coroutines, you can have a look at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html[Coroutines Overview].

=== Ktor

https://ktor.io/[Ktor] is a Kotlin framework designed for building asynchronous servers and clients.
It provides a robust toolkit for making HTTP requests and handling responses, making it an
excellent choice for frontend applications that need to communicate with a backend server.
Ktor's client library is highly customizable and supports various features essential for
frontend development.

== Compose Multiplatform

Compose Multiplatform is a UI framework that enables developers to create user interfaces
for Android, iOS, desktop, and web applications using a single codebase. It is built on
the principles of Jetpack Compose, providing a declarative way to build UIs.

To get started with Compose Multiplatform, see the https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/[Compose Multiplatform page].
Many resources from https://developer.android.com/compose[Jetpack Compose] may be used for learning
and as reference, but keep in mind that some of the information may not have a multiplatform
integration yet.

=== Material 3

Material 3, also known as Material You, is the latest version of Google's Material Design system.
It offers new components, dynamic theming, and updated guidelines to create a more personalized
and adaptive user experience.

The https://m3.material.io/[Material 3 website] gives a good introduction into user interface
design and Material 3.

=== Decompose

Decompose is a library for managing the lifecycle of components in Compose Multiplatform
applications. It provides tools for navigating between screens and managing state across
different parts of an application.

The main features of Decompose include navigation, state management and component lifecycle.
You can find out more and get started via the https://arkivanov.github.io/Decompose/[Decompose documentation].

=== MVIKotlin

MVIKotlin is a library for implementing the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern in
Kotlin applications. It is particularly useful for managing complex state and side effects in a
predictable manner. In combination with Decompose it provides a great foundation and
unified structure for the UI components.

You can find out more at https://arkivanov.github.io/MVIKotlin/.

=== Essenty

Essenty is a collection of utility libraries that complement the Kotlin ecosystem,
particularly useful in Compose Multiplatform projects. It includes tools for handling events,
lifecycles, and other common tasks in a type-safe and idiomatic way.

Similar to MVIKotlin, it adds the foundation and structure of the UI module and plays an
essential part in Decompose.

For more information, you can have a look at https://github.com/arkivanov/Essenty[GitHub - Essenty].
