= New UI

== Introduction

The new UI that is introduced is a standalone frontend client that makes use of Solr's API.
It is written in Kotlin and uses Compose Multiplatform as the UI framework.

== Overview

Since UI development mostly relies on different technologies and frameworks than backends use,
the documentation is covering the following topics for new and experienced developers:

- Technology Overview
- Module Structure and Elements
- Component Development
- Testing and Deployment

== Notes

All the references to files and directories in the UI documentation are from within
the `solr/ui` module, if not otherwise stated.
