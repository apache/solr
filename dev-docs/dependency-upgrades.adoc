Solr has lots of 3rd party dependencies, defined mainly in `versions.props`.
Keeping them up-to-date is crucial for a number of reasons:

* minimizing the risk of critical CVE vulnerabilities by staying on a recent and supported version
* avoiding "dependency hell", that can arise from falling too far behind

Read the `help/dependencies.txt` file for an in-depth explanation of how gradle is deployed in Solr, using
https://github.com/palantir/gradle-consistent-versions[Gradle consistent-versions] plugin.

== Manual dependency upgrades
In order to upgrade a dependency, you need to run through a number of steps:

1. Identify the available versions from e.g. https://search.maven.org[Maven Central]
2. Update the version in `versions.props` file
3. Run `./gradlew --write-locks` to re-generate `versions.lock`. Note that this may cause a cascading effect where
   the locked version of other dependencies also change.
4. Run `./gradlew updateLicenses` to re-generate SHA1 checksums of the new jar files.
5. Once in a while, a new version of a dependency will transitively bring in brand-new dependencies.
   You'll need to decide whether to keep or exclude them. See `help/dependencies.txt` for details.

== Renovate bot Pull Requests
A member of the Solr community operates a Github bot running https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate[Renovate], which
files Pull Requests to Solr with dependency upgrade proposals. The PRs are labeled `dependencies` and do include
changes resulting from `gradle --write-locks` and `updateLicenses`.

Community members and committers can then review, and if manual changes are needed, help bring the PR to completion.
For many dependencies, a changelog is included in the PR text, which may help guide the upgrade decision.

The scans are run on a schedule. New PRs are filed every Sunday, and only dependency versions that are at least
5 days old are suggested, to guard against bad apples. If a new *major* version of a dependency is available,
that will get its own separate Pull Request, so you can choose.

If an upgrade is decided, simply merge (and backport) the PR. To skip an upgrade, close the PR. If a PR is left open,
it will be re-used and auto updated whenever a newer patch- or minor version gets available. Thus, one can reduce
churn from frequently-updated dependencies by delaying merge until a few weeks before a new release. One can also
choose to change to a less frequent schedule or disable the bot, by editing `renovate.json`

=== Configuring renovate.json
While the bot runs on a https://github.com/solrbot/renovate-github-action[GitHub repo external to the project],
the bot behavior can be tailored by editing `.github/renovate.json` in this project.
See https://docs.renovatebot.com[Renovatebot docs] for available options.
