# Gradle Help Documentation

This directory contains text files that provide help documentation for various Gradle tasks and project workflows in Solr. 

## Purpose

These text files serve as the content for Gradle's help tasks. When users run commands like `./gradlew helpWorkflow` or `./gradlew helpTests`, Gradle displays the content of the corresponding text file in this directory.
