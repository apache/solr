Code formatting
===============


---
Starting with (SOLR-14920) Java code is enforced to comply with
google-java-format conventions. In theory you shouldn't worry about
what the convention actually looks like - write the code in any way
you like and then run:

./gradlew tidy

prior to running your regular precommit checks. This will reformat
your code so that it complies with the convention and passes gradle
'check' task.

IMPORTANT: There is *no* way to mark sections of the code as excluded
from formatting. This is by design and cannot be altered. In vast
majority of cases the formatter will do a great job of cleaning up the
code. To exclude files from being formatted investigate the spotless.gradle
build script.
