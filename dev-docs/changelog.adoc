= Adding a Changelog Entry to Apache Solr
:toc:
:toclevels: 2
:icons: font

The project no longer maintains a monolithic *CHANGES.txt* file directly.
Instead, we create small YAML fragments **per bug-fix or feature**, checked into
the `solr/changelog/unreleased/ folder`. At release time these fragments are
organized in versioned folders and collated into a human-readable *CHANGELOG.md* file.

This document walks you through the workflow, explains the Gradle helpers
available, and finishes with a concrete example fragment. We use a tool called
https://logchange.dev/tools/logchange/[logchange] as a gradle plugin to manage
the changelog.

== 1. Workflow Overview

. Make a feature branch with a descriptive name like 'SOLR-12345-fix-memory-leak'.
. Implement your change
. Run `./gradlew writeChangelog`
. Edit the generated YAML file in `changelog/unreleased/` to add a clear, user-focused description.
. Commit the YAML fragment along with the code change.
. Open your PR as usual.

== 2. Directory Layout

[source]
----
solr/
└── changelog/
    ├── unreleased/         ← new fragments live here
    |   └── SOLR-12345-fix-memory-leak.yml
    ├── v10.0.0/            ← changes in already released version
    └── v10.0.1/
----

== 3. The YAML format

Below is an example of a changelog yaml fragment. The full yaml format is https://logchange.dev/tools/logchange/reference/#yaml-entry-format[documented here], but we normally only need `title`, `type`, `authors` and `links`:

[source, yaml]
----
title: Fix nasty bug in CoreContainer shutdown
# added, changed, fixed, deprecated, removed, dependency_update, security, other
type: fixed
authors:
  - name: Alex Doe
    nick: alex_githubid
    url: https://home.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=alex_asfid
links:
  - name: SOLR-12345
    url: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-12345
----

=== 3.1 Tool to draft a YAML for your change

We have a gradle task that bootstraps a YAML file in the `changelog/unreleased/` directory. The task will use your current branch name as a file name and also title, and will
try to parse JIRA id from the branch name if it exists to add the `links`.

Invoke the task with:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew writeChangelog
----

The task will use your git `user.name` as display name by default, but if you
add your name, GitHub username, and optionally Apache ID to the
`gradle.properties` file at the root of the Solr git checkout, this task will
use that information. Example:

[source, properties]
----
# Changelog generator settings (./gradlew writeChangelog)
user.name=Alex Doe
user.githubid=alex_githubid
user.asfid=alex_asfid
----

TIP: Aliases for `writeChangelog` task are `changelog` and `newChangelog`.

== 4. Writing Good Entries

* **Audience** is end-users and administrators, not committers.
* If the change is super minor, like a typo, don't bother adding a yaml file.
* Keep the entry short and focused on the user impact.
* Choose the correct *type*:
** `added` for new features
** `changed` for improvements to existing code
** `fixed` for bug fixes
** `deprecated` for deprecated features
** `removed` for code removed in major releases
** `dependency_update` for updates to dependencies
** `security` for security-related changes
** `other` for anything else, like the build or documentation
* Reference issues as `SOLR-12345` or GitHub `PR#123`.

== 5. Changelog Validation in Pull Requests

The `validate-changelog` GitHub workflow automatically checks that:

. **CHANGES.txt is not edited directly** - All changes must use the YAML fragment approach
. **A changelog entry is added** - Code changes must include a corresponding YAML file in `changelog/unreleased/`

If your change does not require a changelog entry, it is still possible to merge the PR.

== 6. For release managers

=== 6.1 Gradle tasks for logchange

The logchange gradle plugin offers some tasks, here are the two most important:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Task | Purpose

| `logchangeGenerate`
| Generates changelog file `/CHANGELOG.md` based on `.yml` entries and archives (does not moves any files)

| `logchangeRelease`
| Creates a new changelog release by moving files from `changelog/unreleased/` directory to `changelog/vX.Y.Z` directory
|===

These are integrated in the Release Wizard.

=== 6.2 Migration tool

There is a migration tool in `dev-tools/scripts/changes2logchange.py` for one-time use during the transition.
It will bulk convert the entire `solr/CHANGES.txt` file to files in the `changelog/` folder and versioned sub folders.

The tool can also be used by a developer who needs to convert many entries from work-in-progress after the migration
cutover. You can paste one or more entries and get them converted in the Terminal as follows:

[source,bash]
----
cat << EOF | python3 dev-tools/scripts/changes2logchange.py -
* SOLR-17960: Removed TikaLanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor.
  Use LangDetectLanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor or
  OpenNLPLangDetectUpdateProcessor instead. (janhoy)
EOF
----

which will output to `stdout`:

[source,yaml]
----
title: Removed TikaLanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor. Use LangDetectLanguageIdentifierUpdateProcessor
  or OpenNLPLangDetectUpdateProcessor instead.
type: other # added, changed, fixed, deprecated, removed, dependency_update, security, other
authors:
- name: janhoy
links:
- name: SOLR-17960
  url: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-17960
