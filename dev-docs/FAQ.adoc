== FAQ

This document provides a quick reference for common developer questions.

=== What do I do with NOTICE.txt if I don't have one to satisfy Gradle?

You create an empty file, similar to the `/solr/licenses/antlr4-runtime-NOTICE.txt`

=== What are best practices for branches in Git?

Most committers already use a private fork branch for PRs.  Use of central branches
is ok for very collaborative work, but 95% of the time it is better to use a private
branch to avoid extra mailing list traffic etc.

Periodically review https://github.com/apache/solr/branches/all to see if you have
created a branch that can be deleted.

=== Running Solr in Docker

You can run Solr in Docker via the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr).

To run Solr in a container and expose the Solr port, run:

`docker run -p 8983:8983 solr`

In order to start Solr in cloud mode, run the following.

`docker run -p 8983:8983 solr solr-fg -c`

For documentation on using the official docker builds, please refer to the [DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr).
Up to date documentation for running locally built images of this branch can be found in the [local reference guide](solr/solr-ref-guide/src/running-solr-in-docker.adoc).

There is also a gradle task for building custom Solr images from your local checkout.
These local images are built identically to the official image except for retrieving the Solr artifacts locally instead of from the official release.
This can be useful for testing out local changes as well as creating custom images for yourself or your organization.
The task will output the image name to use at the end of the build.

`./gradlew docker`

For more info on building an image, run:

`./gradlew helpDocker`

=== Whats the fastest build lifecycle for frontend work on Solr Admin?

Run `gradle dev`, and then `cd ./packaging/build/dev/`.  Fire up your cluster
via `bin/solr start -e cloud -noprompt` and then as you make changes to assets in `/solr/webapp/web`,
run `gradle dev` to redeploy the web assets. Do a  hard refresh in your browser
to pick up your changes.

=== How do we ensure coding standards and quality?

We use a number of tools for ensuring that Solr's codebase follows our community standards.
The most important tool is the very rich testing infrastructure that Solr enjoys.
We strive for testing of every aspect of Solr.
If you find a bug, write a test demonstrating it, so we can ensure that once the bug is squashed, it stays squashed.

Beyond testing, we also have some tools for ensuring coding standards are followed.
[Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) is used to format the Java source code so that everyone uses the same formatting patterns.
Run Spotless via:

`./gradlew tidy`

Learn more via `./gradlew :helpFormatting`.

The Eclipse IDE's linting tool ECJ is applied as part of the `check` task.

[Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) goes beyond static type checking and recommends fixes for common bug patterns.
Error Prone is run during the CI build on Jenkins, however to run it locally (and skip the tests) do:

`./gradlew check -Pvalidation.errorprone=true -x test`

In the same space as Errorprone is [Sonatype Lift](https://lift.sonatype.com/), an automated code reviewer that is run when you push your PR to Github.
As with human reviewers, it's a good practice to respond to each comment to reflect on the recommendation.
Of course, automated code analysis will turn up false-positives.
Tip: There is no point in responding to Lift with the ignore command because we don't gate PRs on Lift.

There are Java classes and methods that Solr doesn't allow.
This exclusion is enforced by the [Forbidden APIs](https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis) tool and is applied as part of the `check` task.
Learn more about using Forbidden APIs via `./gradlew :helpForbiddenApis`.

To run a check for dependencies of Solr that have security vulnerabilities using the [OWASP](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.owasp.dependencycheck) Gradle plugin.
Run via:

`./gradlew owasp`

There are a number of other tasks that get run to validate the source code, and you can find them in the  [./gradle/validation](./gradle/validation) source tree.
