== FAQ

This document provides a quick reference for frequently questioned concepts and features in Credentials.

=== What do I do with NOTICE.txt if I don't have one to satisfy Gradle?

You create an empty file, similar to the `/solr/licenses/antlr4-runtime-NOTICE.txt`

=== What are best practices for branches in Git?

Most committers already use a private fork branch for PRs.  Use of central branches
is ok for very collaborative work, but 95% of the time it is better to use a private
branch to avoid extra mailing list traffic etc.

Periodically review https://github.com/apache/solr/branches/all to see if you have
created a branch that can be deleted.
