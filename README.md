# Welcome to the Apache Solr project!
-----------------------------------

Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source search platform for all your
enterprise, e-commerce, and analytics needs, built on [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/).

For a complete description of the Solr project, team composition, source
code repositories, and other details, please see the Solr web site at
https://solr.apache.org/

## Download

Downloads for Apache Solr distributions are available at https://solr.apache.org/downloads.html.

## Running Solr

### Installing Solr

The Reference Guide contains an entire [Deployment Guide](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/system-requirements.html) to walk you through installing Solr.

### Running Solr in Docker

You can run Solr in Docker via the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/solr).
Learn more about [Solr in Docker](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/solr-in-docker.html)

### Running Solr on Kubernetes

Solr has official support for running on Kubernetes, in the official Docker image.
Please refer to the [Solr Operator](https://solr.apache.org/operator) home for details, tutorials and instructions.

## How to Use

Solr includes a few examples to help you get started. To run a specific example, enter:

```
  bin/solr start -e <EXAMPLE> where <EXAMPLE> is one of:
    cloud:         SolrCloud example
    techproducts:  Comprehensive example illustrating many of Solr's core capabilities
    schemaless:    Schema-less example (schema is inferred from data during indexing)
    films:         Example of starting with _default configset and adding explicit fields dynamically    
```

For instance, if you want to run the techproducts example, enter:

```
  bin/solr start -e techproducts
```
